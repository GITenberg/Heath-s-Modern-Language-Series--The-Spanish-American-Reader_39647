<h3><a name="AUTHORS_FOREWORD" id="AUTHORS_FOREWORD"></a>AUTHOR&rsquo;S FOREWORD</h3>

<p>As an educational commissioner from the Argentine Republic to the Panama
Pacific International Exposition, I was very much gratified to note the
constantly increasing interest on the part of the High Schools and
Colleges of this country in the study of the Spanish language. At the
same time, realizing from personal investigation that most of those who
study Spanish are prompted to do so by the present widespread interest
in Spanish America as a legitimate and profitable field for American
enterprise, I could not help wondering whether the reading matter used
in connection with the study of this language should not be enlarged so
as to include some discussion of the subjects directly connected with
the work for which these students were preparing themselves.</p>

<p>One of the most amazing things in this country to the visiting Latin
American is the almost absolute lack of anything like adequate
information as to what the Spanish American countries are doing in the
present, or what they have achieved in the past. This lack of
information is particularly noticeable in the high-school texts upon
History and Geography&mdash;not to mention those on the less common subjects
of social and political economy&mdash;and is most lamentable of all in the
text-books in Spanish used by the students of that language.</p>

<p>It seemed to me, therefore, that there was great need of and that the
time was ripe for a book which, while affording the student of Spanish
abundant exercise in the reading of that tongue, would at the same time
give him some adequate idea of the physical aspects of the various
Southern republics, their commercial and transportation routes, their
agricultural and industrial products, the opportunities they offer for
business and industrial investment, and the manners and customs of the
people themselves together with their social and political creeds and
aspirations, as expressed by their most noted statesmen and writers. It
seemed to me that such a book could not fail to be favorably received by
both teachers and students in this country.</p>

<p>Moreover, as an educator and a consistent and enthusiastic worker for
the establishment of closer social and educational relations between the
Americas, it seemed to me that the eagerness with which the American
youth is taking up the study of Spanish affords the best possible
opportunity for inserting the &ldquo;entering wedge,&rdquo; as it were, of that
sympathetic understanding which will eventually break down the barrier
which has hitherto kept the independent peoples of this continent apart
from each other, despite the progress in science, art and education.</p>

<p>But a knowledge of Spanish alone will not conduce toward the realization
of the Pan-American ideal, either in the material or moral sense,
unless that knowledge is used as the touchstone toward that deeper and
more vital understanding of the social status, ideals and aspirations of
&ldquo;the other Americans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The usual text-book in Spanish dwells upon the achievements, character
and ideals of the Spanish nation and it reveals to the student a
wonderful people and a marvelous field of human activity. But it
completely ignores the increasingly complex and important phenomena,
both social and political, which are being developed in the Hispanic
section of the New World,&mdash;phenomena which are in many ways more akin to
those of this country than to those of Spain.</p>

<p>Here in the New World, new environments and new conditions have given
rise to new ways of living and have created a long series of new
activities and institutions, with corresponding modifications in the
language of the people,&mdash;all of which are entitled to a place in the
reading matter of the American student of Spanish and claim their
rightful share of his attention. It seems to me that a knowledge of the
New World&rsquo;s contribution to the original Spanish racial inheritance
should be of peculiar interest and value to the student of Spanish in
the United States, as it will reveal many of the same agencies which
have modified the original inheritance of the first settlers in his own
country and directed their evolution. He will find in the continent to
the south of him geographical conditions which almost exactly duplicate
those in the northern; he will find the same lack of hampering tradition
and the same free play of individual effort and opportunity; the same
boundless expanse of territory and the same generous breadth of horizon.
He will find also the same problems in education, immigration,
naturalization, racial amalgamation and government, and a literature
which cannot fail to thrill him with a keen sense of <i>relationship</i> to
his Latin-American cousins.</p>

<p>Even to understand Spain, Spanish America must be taken into account,
since, to paraphrase the words of a well-known English poet, &ldquo;They
little know Hispania, who only España know,&rdquo; and certainly no
consideration of Spanish literature can afford to ignore the action and
reaction, the play and interplay of thought and feeling which, finding
their earlier expression largely in belligerent verse, have gradually
mellowed into the noble and tender sentiment of friendship and unity of
spirit which to-day permeates the literature of both the mother land and
that of her independent daughters in the New World. To-day the mother
land sends her millions to the free countries of the New World where,
far from being compelled to abandon their cherished ideals, they are
encouraged to expand them to undreamed-of horizons where the romantic
soul of Spain finds its long-sought-for opportunity.</p>

<p>To understand rightfully the present renaissance in Spain as revealed in
the almost unprecedented prosperity of her rural population, the
multiplying of schools and libraries endowed in many instances by
unknown &ldquo;hands across the sea,&rdquo; the American student of Spanish must
take into account the transcendental <i>symbiosis</i> through the agency of
which lethargic Spain is being quickened and vitalized by her former
colonies. He must perceive and appreciate that the Spanish world as a
whole is again expanding, and that there is no part of its complex and
diverse whole which has not made its specific contribution toward that
beneficent achievement. He must realize that no study of the language
common to all these parts is complete, therefore, which fails to keep in
full view the complete background.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Three unusual features should commend this Spanish American Reader to
the attention of the teacher of Spanish. <i>First</i>, the wide range in
style and subject matter, combined with the dominantly idiomatic form of
expression, enlivened by the dialogue in which a large part of the text
matter is written. Such <i>living</i> forms of expression, embodied as they
are in subjects closely related to Spanish American activities and
conditions of to-day, afford the most practical kind of material for
everyday use. <i>Second</i>, the opportunity this book offers for oral and
written exercises by substituting the numerous &ldquo;Variants&rdquo;&mdash;a practically
new and important feature&mdash;in the footnotes for the original expressions
in the text. <i>Third</i>, the very considerable mass of first-hand
information bearing directly upon subjects of the greatest interest to
students in the United States, and the opportunity they afford for the
discussion of Spanish American topics.</p>

<p>I cannot close this foreword without acknowledging my indebtedness to
the Pan-American Union for exact data and information; to the New York
Public Library and the Hispanic Society of America for the facilities
afforded in the copying of excerpts; to <i>Las Novedades</i> for permission
to reprint certain text matter; to Dr. Homero Serís for his assistance
in collecting Spanish Americanisms; and, last but certainly not least,
to the Spanish Department of D. C. Heath &amp; Co., the publishers, for
valuable suggestions and assistance in planning the book and in the
preparation of the manuscript.</p>

<p>&mdash;En las habitaciones, de madera, y los pisos pueden ser lisos, es
decir,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> sin dibujos, o de parquet, y en este caso<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> se escogen los

<p>&mdash;En unas cuantas ciudades que conservan las tradiciones de la madre
patria. Por lo general se ven verjas en los jardines, en las ventanas
pequeñas o las que ofrecen un acceso peligroso desde la calle, las
cuales<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> por eso se mantienen abiertas sólo <i>de</i> día.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> El herrero

materiales de construcción. Aquí entran<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> no sólo azulejos para los
cuartos de baño y la cocina<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>; mosaicos para las veredas o aceras,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>

<p>&mdash;¿Se emplea<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> el gas o la electricidad en el alumbrado?</p>

<p>&mdash;Uno y otro sistema<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>; pero en las ciudades grandes el gas se usa con
preferencia como combustible en la cocina. Como iba diciendo,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> una
casa electricista corre con la instalación de<a name="page_007" id="page_007"></a> conductores, medidores,
toma-corrientes,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> llaves, fusibles, así como de las campanillas con
sus cuadros indicadores, pilas, transformadores, etc., mientras otra
casa especialista, de las<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> denominadas<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> de artefactos de luz
eléctrica, proporciona las arañas, los pendientes, los brazos, los
faroles y los «plafonniers.»</p>

<p>Por su parte, el cerrajero<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> se encarga de las cerraduras y cerrojos
de las puertas, pestillos, manijas, bisagras, fallebas y pasadores.</p>

<p>El cuarto de baño queda al cuidado de<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> otra casa especialista,
cuya<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> tarea consiste en la instalación de la bañadera y de los
lavatorios o lavabos (éstos pueden ser de hierro esmaltado, porcelana,
loza o loza-piedra), el retrete, las repisas, toallero, espejos, amén
<i>de</i><a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> un pequeño armario para las medicinas caseras y útiles de
tocador que debe tenerse siempre a mano.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>Mientras<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> estas operaciones tienen<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> lugar, los pintores blanquean
o pintan las paredes a la cal,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> al fresco o al óleo y, en esta última
forma, las puertas y ventanas, las que reciben<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> luego una mano de
barniz cada una. Las piezas suelen entapizarse<a name="page_008" id="page_008"></a> con papel, cubriendo
anteriormente las paredes con papel de forro, que es material muy
barato; y cuando aquéllas<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> están completamente secas, se las reviste
con el papel que ha de quedar permanentemente. Entretanto<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> los cielos
rasos de yeso se han terminado, inclusive el florón central<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> y las
molduras del contorno.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Cuál es la distribución que se da<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> por lo general a las
habitaciones de una casa de familia?</p>

<p>&mdash;En países de tierra barata,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> predomina el estilo antiguo español,
caracterizado por<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> la planta de un solo piso, a veces en dos alas o
cuerpos de edificio con un patio en el centro. Las habitaciones,
espaciosas, bien iluminadas, de altos techos, se suceden una tras
otra<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> en línea perpendicular a la calle. En algunos casos el edificio
está precedido por un jardín. Las construcciones terminan hacia el fondo
en la cocina, habitaciones de servicio, patio y demás dependencias. No
es raro que la propiedad se extienda desde una calle hasta la que limita
la manzana por el lado opuesto, y en este caso la parte posterior está
ocupada por el huerto o fondo, como familiarmente se le<a name="page_009" id="page_009"></a> llama, y donde
suele haber añosos árboles frutales. Este es también el sitio para el
corral <i>de</i> aves domésticas y los pesebres para los caballitos<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> de
los niños de la casa.</p>

<p>Este tipo de viviendas requiere mucho espacio y sólo pudo ser general,
de Méjico a Buenos Aires, cuando el metro de tierra se vendía por
unos<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> centavos. Aun hoy se ven estas mansiones en algunas ciudades
adonde<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> no ha llegado todavía la fiebre de la especulación en bienes
raíces. En los centros densamente poblados, donde<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> los solares
urbanos tienen un alto valor, las casas de varios pisos se han impuesto
como una necesidad económica. Allí se ha generalizado, desde hace
algunos años, la casa de estilo marcadamente parisiense, y de aquí
que<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> se la designe con el nombre francés de «petit hôtel.» A la
puerta exterior principal que da a<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> la calle, sigue el zaguán, que
conduce al <i>hall</i>,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> palabra<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> muy corriente en el Río de la Plata
desde que los nuevos tipos de edificación han comenzado a reemplazar a
los antiguos. En torno del<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> <i>hall</i> se hallan la sala, un escritorio
y el comedor. En los pisos superiores están los dormitorios.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Qué lugar se destina a la cocina en estas casas,<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> necesariamente
pequeñas?<a name="page_010" id="page_010"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;Suele hallarse<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> en un zótano o en el último piso de la casa. Esto
se hace de intento<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> para darle mayor ventilación.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>&mdash;¿Tiene el mobiliario alguna particularidad<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>?</p>

sofá, dos sillones, varias sillas, un piano de cola, vertical o de los
llamados mecánicos, mesas de todos tamaños, consolas, canapés,

La repisa de la chimenea puede estar adornada con floreros, estatuitas,
algún<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> reloj u otro<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> objeto semejante.</p>

<p>Los cuadros que hay en las paredes pueden ser al óleo, al pastel o
acuarelas, aunque no dejan de<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> verse algunos<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> al carbón, sobre
todo si son<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> retratos. Las fotografías de deudos y amigos, los

completamente por una alfombra, o parcialmente por uno o varios tapetes.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Cómo se amuebla el <i>hall</i> de esas casas?</p>

<p>&mdash;Con muebles adecuados y sencillos de madera o de mimbre. Además
de<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> la mesa central, de las sillas y de alguna que otra<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>

perchas para dejar los abrigos, sombreros, paraguas y bastones.</p>

<p>El escritorio o biblioteca suele tener una o más mesas de trabajo, ya de
la forma clásica, ya del estilo que llaman americano, ya,
finalmente,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> del que lleva con el nombre de escritorio de ministro,

que se sostienen a favor de una armazón de hierro. En las casas

resguardando el patio y las habitaciones del ardor de los rayos solares.
El patio es, en la América española, lo que el fuego del hogar en los
climas del norte. Es testigo de la vida toda de la familia, desde que el
niño lo anima con sus juegos hasta que los ancianos alegran sus
postreras horas aspirando su aire embalsamado.</p>

débese la prosperidad que han alcanzado<a name="FNanchor_30_210" id="FNanchor_30_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_210" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> algunas de las tiendas de
departamentos a que Ud. se refiere<a name="FNanchor_31_211" id="FNanchor_31_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_211" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>; tiendas que se han generalizado

<p>&mdash;¿Por qué medios la mercadería que sale de las fábricas pasa a
manos<a name="FNanchor_34_214" id="FNanchor_34_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_214" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> del consumidor?</p>

<p>&mdash;En cada ramo<a name="FNanchor_35_215" id="FNanchor_35_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_215" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> hay casas mayoristas<a name="FNanchor_36_216" id="FNanchor_36_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_216" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> o al por mayor,<a name="FNanchor_37_217" id="FNanchor_37_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_217" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> que
venden la mercadería en grandes cantidades. Más de una<a name="FNanchor_38_218" id="FNanchor_38_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_218" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> importa<a name="FNanchor_39_219" id="FNanchor_39_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_219" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
del extranjero artículos manufacturados y por esta razón dichas
casas<a name="FNanchor_40_220" id="FNanchor_40_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_220" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> mantienen relaciones comerciales con las fábricas de Europa y
Estados Unidos o con fábricas del país en que operan. A tales comercios
no acude el consumidor sino el mercader al por menor o vendedor al
detalle o al menudeo, según<a name="page_019" id="page_019"></a> se le llama. Por eso<a name="FNanchor_41_221" id="FNanchor_41_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_221" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> casi ninguna
de<a name="FNanchor_42_222" id="FNanchor_42_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_222" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> estas casas tiene a su frente escaparates u otros medios de
atraer al transeunte. Tampoco<a name="FNanchor_43_223" id="FNanchor_43_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_223" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> se hallan estos comercios en los
barrios más concurridos.</p>

<p>&mdash;Al entrar<a name="FNanchor_44_224" id="FNanchor_44_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_224" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> en una casa de ventas<a name="FNanchor_45_225" id="FNanchor_45_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_225" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> al por mayor, lo primero<a name="FNanchor_46_226" id="FNanchor_46_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_226" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
que se ve es un espacioso salón, donde se halla en exhibición la
nueva<a name="FNanchor_47_227" id="FNanchor_47_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_227" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> mercadería. Las mesas y mostradores están ocupados por los
muestrarios. En otra sala, que se llama oficina o despacho, están los
altos escritorios,<a name="FNanchor_48_228" id="FNanchor_48_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_228" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> ante los cuales empleados diligentes trabajan en
los libros de comercio.<a name="FNanchor_49_229" id="FNanchor_49_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_229" class="fnanchor">[49]</a><a name="page_020" id="page_020"></a> Estos establecimientos hacen gran parte de
sus transacciones a crédito,<a name="FNanchor_50_230" id="FNanchor_50_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_230" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> siendo por esto muy común en ellos el
uso de los documentos<a name="FNanchor_51_231" id="FNanchor_51_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_231" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> y papeles de comercio.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Qué nombre general llevan los comercios que venden directamente al
consumidor?</p>

<p>&mdash;Denomínaselos casas minoristas o establecimientos al por menor, al
menudeo o al detalle.</p>

<p>&mdash;Supongo<a name="FNanchor_52_232" id="FNanchor_52_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_232" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> que a estos últimos acude el público para comprar<a name="FNanchor_53_233" id="FNanchor_53_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_233" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
alimento y vestido.<a name="FNanchor_54_234" id="FNanchor_54_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_234" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>&mdash;Así es, en efecto. Estos comercios no se diferencian de las tiendas
que tan familiares son a toda persona civilizada.<a name="FNanchor_55_235" id="FNanchor_55_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_235" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> En la América
latina como aquí, las casas de negocios tienen a veces un surtido
variadísimo<a name="FNanchor_56_236" id="FNanchor_56_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_236" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> de existencias, que exhiben en todas las formas
imaginables para<a name="FNanchor_57_237" id="FNanchor_57_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_237" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> atraer los compradores. El cliente suele encontrar
en esas casas todas las marcas de un objeto de venta<a name="FNanchor_58_238" id="FNanchor_58_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_238" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> y las novedades
de la estación.<a name="page_021" id="page_021"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;¿Cuentan esas casas con un personal<a name="FNanchor_59_239" id="FNanchor_59_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_239" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> numeroso?</p>

<p>&mdash;Desde una sola persona que es a la vez dueño,<a name="FNanchor_60_240" id="FNanchor_60_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_240" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> dependiente y
mandadero, hasta diez mil empleados por cada establecimiento, cifra que
no es raro<a name="FNanchor_61_241" id="FNanchor_61_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_241" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> encontrar en los comercios de primer<a name="FNanchor_62_242" id="FNanchor_62_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_242" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> orden.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Cómo se indica el precio de las mercaderías?</p>

<p>&mdash;En algunas tiendas, sobre todo las de poca monta,<a name="FNanchor_63_243" id="FNanchor_63_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_243" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> los precios no
están a la vista. Pero en los establecimientos mayores el precio<a name="FNanchor_64_244" id="FNanchor_64_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_244" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
fijo es la<a name="FNanchor_65_245" id="FNanchor_65_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_245" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> regla, y esto ha contribuido a generalizar el sistema.</p>

<p>Este es preferible al método que obliga al cliente a regatear los
precios, y al vendedor a porfiar en sus demandas, lo que convierte la
transacción en un altercado. El que va a comprar<a name="FNanchor_66_246" id="FNanchor_66_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_246" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> sabe siempre cuánto
cuestan<a name="FNanchor_67_247" id="FNanchor_67_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_247" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> los artículos que se le muestran.</p>

<p>&mdash;El precio fijo asegura al cliente contra el abuso, y le da la<a name="page_022" id="page_022"></a>
seguridad de que nunca pagará demasiado caro<a name="FNanchor_68_248" id="FNanchor_68_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_248" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> por lo que<a name="FNanchor_69_249" id="FNanchor_69_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_249" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> compra.</p>

<p>Las casas de cierta importancia disponen de las prendas que han pasado
de moda<a name="FNanchor_70_250" id="FNanchor_70_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_250" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> vendiéndolas más barato,<a name="FNanchor_71_251" id="FNanchor_71_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_251" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> rebajando<a name="FNanchor_72_252" id="FNanchor_72_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_252" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> los precios de
otras, haciendo la liquidación de un mal<a name="FNanchor_73_253" id="FNanchor_73_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_253" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> año o de algún saldo. A
veces se dan «quemazones» sensacionales, que pueden resultar en un buen
negocio para quien las organiza, porque en muchos de tales casos se
trata de géneros averiados comprados a bajísimo precio<a name="FNanchor_74_254" id="FNanchor_74_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_254" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> o de
artículos que se intentó<a name="FNanchor_75_255" id="FNanchor_75_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_255" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> pasar de contrabando y que la aduana
decomisó poniéndolos luego en remate donde los comerciantes los obtienen
por casi nada.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Cuál es el procedimiento que se usa para percibir el importe<a name="FNanchor_76_256" id="FNanchor_76_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_256" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> de
las ventas?<a name="page_023" id="page_023"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;Hasta hace unos veinte años el comprador pagaba al dependiente, quien,
por eso, llenaba en cierto modo las funciones de cajero del
establecimiento. Pero hoy día las cajas registradoras se hallan en cada
uno<a name="FNanchor_77_257" id="FNanchor_77_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_257" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> de los pueblos y villorrios de la América latina. En las tiendas
que cuentan con estos aparatos, el comprador paga a la persona que lo
atiende, presentándole previamente la boleta en que el dependiente ha
ido anotando el importe de cada artículo comprado. El cajero o la cajera
entrega<a name="FNanchor_78_258" id="FNanchor_78_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_258" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> a su vez<a name="FNanchor_79_259" id="FNanchor_79_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_259" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> un recibo<a name="FNanchor_80_260" id="FNanchor_80_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_260" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> por la cantidad percibida.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Se satisfacen siempre al contado estas pequeñas compras?</p>

<p>&mdash;No es raro que los parroquianos tengan<a name="FNanchor_81_261" id="FNanchor_81_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_261" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> cuenta abierta en las casas
de donde se surten o proveen a menudo. La posibilidad de este arreglo
depende, como es natural, de la confianza que inspire<a name="FNanchor_82_262" id="FNanchor_82_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_262" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> cada cual.<a name="FNanchor_83_263" id="FNanchor_83_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_263" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
En caso de abrirse un crédito<a name="FNanchor_84_264" id="FNanchor_84_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_264" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> al parroquiano, las compras se cargan
en cuenta<a name="FNanchor_85_265" id="FNanchor_85_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_265" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> y ésta se liquida cada mes.<a name="FNanchor_86_266" id="FNanchor_86_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_266" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>&mdash;¿Y si<a name="FNanchor_87_267" id="FNanchor_87_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_267" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> el deudor no paga?<a name="FNanchor_88_268" id="FNanchor_88_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_268" class="fnanchor">[88]</a><a name="page_024" id="page_024"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;Se acude a la justicia ordinaria, entablando una demanda contra el
insolvente.<a name="FNanchor_89_269" id="FNanchor_89_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_269" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> El embargo y el remate judicial suelen ser el resultado
de la acción legal. La prisión por deudas ha sido abolida<a name="FNanchor_90_270" id="FNanchor_90_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_270" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> en la
legislación de todos y cada uno<a name="FNanchor_91_271" id="FNanchor_91_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_271" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> de esos países.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Se envían las compras<a name="FNanchor_92_272" id="FNanchor_92_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_272" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> al domicilio de los clientes?</p>

<p>&mdash;Ciertamente, por medio de carros de reparto o mandaderos. Aparte de
esto, muchas tiendas mantienen una clientela numerosa en los distritos
rurales, a la que sirven remitiendo sus pedidos por encomienda postal.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Dónde se compran los muebles?</p>

<p>&mdash;Pues<a name="FNanchor_1_273" id="FNanchor_1_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_273" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> se compran, ya en las tiendas de departamentos, ya en casas
especiales, llamadas mueblerías. Entre éstas, no pocas<a name="FNanchor_2_274" id="FNanchor_2_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_274" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> procuran traer
parroquia y evitar la concurrencia de los<a name="page_025" id="page_025"></a> competidores, vendiendo<a name="FNanchor_3_275" id="FNanchor_3_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_275" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
los muebles a plazos, sistema que está en mucha boga.</p>

<p>&mdash;Y si Ud. necesita una pieza especial de mobiliario, verbigracia, una
manija para una gaveta, un candado, clavos, tornillos, o herramientas de
uso casero como un martillo, una lima, unas tenazas o alicates, ¿dónde
los compra Ud.?<a name="FNanchor_4_276" id="FNanchor_4_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_276" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>&mdash;Esas mercaderías menudas de hierro y acero se adquieren en la
ferretería o quincallería. Mas si se desea hacer composturas o
reparaciones en los muebles, habrá que<a name="FNanchor_5_277" id="FNanchor_5_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_277" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> ocurrir a un ebanista, ya se
trate de añadir una pieza, completar un dibujo o reponer una moldura; si
en cambio hubiera que<a name="FNanchor_6_278" id="FNanchor_6_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_278" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> guarnecer de nuevo almohadones, sillas, sofás,
etc., proveerlos de relleno, resortes o cubiertas, Ud. acudiría a<a name="FNanchor_7_279" id="FNanchor_7_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_279" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> un
tapicero, quien además entiende en todo lo que se refiere a<a name="FNanchor_8_280" id="FNanchor_8_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_280" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
cortinados, cenefas, tapices, etc.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿El sistema de provisión de alimentos es idéntico al que se usa en los
Estados Unidos?</p>

<p>&mdash;Con algunas diferencias.<a name="FNanchor_9_281" id="FNanchor_9_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_281" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Por ejemplo, el pan, especialmente el de
mejor calidad,<a name="FNanchor_10_282" id="FNanchor_10_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_282" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> se procura en comercios especiales llamados
panaderías, que expenden además bizcochos, bollos, y a veces galletas.
Los pasteles no son, ni con mucho,<a name="FNanchor_11_283" id="FNanchor_11_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_283" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> tan<a name="page_026" id="page_026"></a> abundantes como aquí y se
compran en pastelerías, así como las tortas y masas. Pero estas últimas,
así como los caramelos, confites, pastillas y dulces, son más propias de
las confiterías. Advierto que el dulce<a name="FNanchor_12_284" id="FNanchor_12_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_284" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> y las golosinas son muy
apreciadas<a name="FNanchor_13_285" id="FNanchor_13_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_285" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> entre los latinos.<a name="FNanchor_14_286" id="FNanchor_14_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_286" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>&mdash;¿Procede de los frigoríficos la carne que se consume en las ciudades?</p>

<p>&mdash;No; de los mataderos, y de allí pasa a las carnicerías o a los
mercados. En estos últimos hay departamentos o puestos como en los
Estados Unidos. Los puestos de carne venden la de vaca, ternera,
cordero, carnero, cerdo o chancho y, además, grasa y tocino; también
aves, como gallinas, pollos, perdices, pavos, patos, gansos, y a veces
hasta los productos de la caza, como liebres y conejos. Asimismo se
obtiene allí el menudo y las vísceras, ambos englobados en el nombre de
<i>achuras</i>, es decir, las tripas o mondongos, el hígado, la molleja, el
corazón, los sesos y la lengua.</p>

<p>&mdash;En cuanto al<a name="FNanchor_15_287" id="FNanchor_15_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_287" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> pescado fresco, se vende en otros puestos, los cuales
exhiben los pescados de agua de mar y de agua dulce, y además ostras,
langostas, langostines, cangrejos y caracoles. Los puestos de legumbres
y verdura tienen papas o patatas, batatas, camotes o patatas dulces;
zapallos o calabazas; zanahorias; mazorcas de maíz tierno; repollos o
coles; lechuga, tomates, nabos, ajos, cebollas, apio, salsifí, rábanos,
berenjenas; porotos, fríjoles o habas; lentejas, <i>chauchas</i>, guisantes o
ejotes y garbanzos. En los puestos de fruta se encuentran las manzanas,<a name="page_027" id="page_027"></a>
los duraznos o melocotones, los higos y las brevas, guindas o cerezas,
peras, nísperos, naranjas, mandarinas, limones, limas y toronjas,
damascos o albaricoques, ciruelas, uvas negras o blancas, frutillas o
fresas, bananas o plátanos, aparte de muchas otras frutas indígenas como
la chirimoya, la papaya, la fruta de conde, la guayaba, el zapote, el
mamey, el mango, el tamarindo, el guanábano y el aguacate.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Tienen Uds. por allí lo que aquí se llama <i>grocery</i>?</p>

<p>&mdash;Correspondería a las tiendas de comestibles que en la América española
se llaman almacenes, abacerías, lonjas, y en algunas partes, bodegas. En
ellas se venden especierías o abarrotes, azúcar, sal, pimienta,
pimentón, mostaza, fiambres, conservas, jabón, velas, vino de mesa,
aceite, vinagre, alcohol o aguardiente, ginebra y otros muchos licores.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Se compra la leche en la ciudad misma o en las lecherías y cremerías
de la campaña?</p>

<p>&mdash;De ambas partes. En algunas ciudades hay <i>tambos</i>, donde se vende
leche fresca, o sea recién ordeñada. Pero el tambo, que es en realidad
un establo de vacas y burras, empezó a desaparecer de los centros
urbanos hace unos veinte años.<a name="FNanchor_16_288" id="FNanchor_16_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_288" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> La leche y la manteca llegan a las
ciudades y pueblos en los trenes de la mañana, enviada por las granjas
de los alrededores y se distribuyen a domicilio. Ciertas cremerías
suelen tener en la ciudad despachos de leche, donde se vende ésta y la
manteca, así como huevos y dulces de leche.</p>

<p>&mdash;Me han informado que en la América latina el comercio y la industria
no están tan general y completamente<a name="FNanchor_17_289" id="FNanchor_17_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_289" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> organizados<a name="page_028" id="page_028"></a><a name="FNanchor_18_290" id="FNanchor_18_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_290" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> como en los
Estados Unidos, resultando de ello<a name="FNanchor_19_291" id="FNanchor_19_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_291" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> el que se conservan allí
ocupaciones que entre nosotros ha tiempo<a name="FNanchor_20_292" id="FNanchor_20_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_292" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> fueron absorbidas por
organizaciones comerciales más vastas. Refiérome a las ocupaciones
propias del zapatero, el sastre, la modista<a name="FNanchor_21_293" id="FNanchor_21_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_293" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> de vestidos, etc.</p>

<p>&mdash;En efecto, nosotros los latino americanos<a name="FNanchor_22_294" id="FNanchor_22_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_294" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> llevamos la ropa a la
medida<a name="FNanchor_23_295" id="FNanchor_23_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_295" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> con más generalidad que<a name="FNanchor_24_296" id="FNanchor_24_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_296" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> los americanos del norte. Sin
embargo, abundan cada día más las casas que venden ropa hecha, tanto
para hombres como para<a name="FNanchor_25_297" id="FNanchor_25_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_297" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> damas.<a name="FNanchor_26_298" id="FNanchor_26_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_298" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> También es verdad que se ven
guanterías y casas de prendas para hombre,<a name="FNanchor_27_299" id="FNanchor_27_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_299" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> en mayor número que en la
Unión; pero no faltan las tiendas modernas con sus departamentos de
calzado, lencería, ropa blanca para señoras, bonetería (medias y
artículos de punto), mercería (agujas, alfileres, horquillas, botones,
hilo, algodón, sedas), perfumería (lociones para el cabello, esencias,
jabones de tocador), artículos de juego y de <i>sport</i>, de viajes
(valijas, neceseres, baúles de camarote, baúles-cómodas, mundos,
canastas de picnic); departamentos de menaje, donde se venden todos los
utensilios necesarios al ama de casa; departamentos de mueblería; y
hasta departamentos sanitarios,<a name="page_029" id="page_029"></a> los cuales proporcionan a Ud. todo lo
necesario<a name="FNanchor_28_300" id="FNanchor_28_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_300" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> para el cuarto de baño.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Qué son los bazares?</p>

<p>&mdash;Emporios de artículos menudos para la casa.<a name="FNanchor_29_301" id="FNanchor_29_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_301" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> En ellos se vende
vajilla de loza o porcelana, cubiertos, artículos de mesa y de cocina,
tales como cacerolas, sartenes, pavas o peroles, ollas, calderas,
cafeteras, teteras, aparte de convoyes para el aderezo de la ensalada.
Pero estos establecimientos van siendo absorbidos<a name="FNanchor_30_302" id="FNanchor_30_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_302" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> por los
mencionados anteriormente.</p>

<p>&mdash;Dentro del género de los establecimientos de surtido variado no
faltarán allí los bric-a-brac....</p>

<p>&mdash;No por cierto<a name="FNanchor_31_303" id="FNanchor_31_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_303" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>; y se les llama, casas de compra y venta o
establecimientos para la venta de artículos de segunda mano. Y no
olvidemos tampoco<a name="FNanchor_32_304" id="FNanchor_32_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_304" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> las casas de empeño, montepíos o montes de piedad;
ni las casas de remate, en las que, según su clase,<a name="FNanchor_33_305" id="FNanchor_33_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_305" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> puede Ud.
comprar desde una estancia, un campo o un solar urbano, hasta la más
insignificante prenda de vestir.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Tienen las droguerías de la América latina el mismo aspecto que las
nuestras?</p>

<p>&mdash;Por el contrario,<a name="FNanchor_34_306" id="FNanchor_34_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_306" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> son bastante diferentes. No se acostumbra vender
en ellas sorbetes, refrescos u otras bebidas; eso<a name="page_030" id="page_030"></a> queda para<a name="FNanchor_35_307" id="FNanchor_35_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_307" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> las
confiterías; tampoco<a name="FNanchor_36_308" id="FNanchor_36_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_308" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> se despachan allí estampillas o sellos de
correo, los cuales se expenden en las sucursales de la administración
postal. No verá Ud. en nuestras farmacias tantos<a name="FNanchor_37_309" id="FNanchor_37_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_309" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> enseres domésticos
y de tualeta.<a name="FNanchor_38_310" id="FNanchor_38_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_310" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Por otra parte, preciso es distinguir en la América
latina la droguería, donde se venden drogas y cuerpos químicos, al por
mayor, de<a name="FNanchor_39_311" id="FNanchor_39_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_311" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> las boticas o farmacias, donde se despachan recetas y se
adquieren específicos y medicinas caseras. En casas que venden
instrumentos ópticos, se encuentran anteojos, lentes quevedos y
antiparras.</p>

<p>&mdash;No habiendo<a name="FNanchor_40_312" id="FNanchor_40_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_312" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> chinos, ¿quiénes hacen el lavado y planchado?</p>

<p>&mdash;Hay talleres especiales de estos ramos, atendidos generalmente por
mujeres. En este género de servicios personales debe Ud. incluir las
tintorerías, los pequeños talleres donde se plancha, se limpia y se
compone ropa; los talleres de grabado para la impresión de tarjetas de
visita y papel de carta; y aun<a name="FNanchor_41_313" id="FNanchor_41_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_313" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> las casas de baños públicos con sus
baños de ducha, de inmersión y turco-romanos; sus piletas de natación,
etc.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Las peluquerías allí tienen también los servicios de manicuras y
limpiabotas?<a name="page_031" id="page_031"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;No tanto el de los limpiabotas, quienes prefieren trabajar en puestos
al aire libre, para atraer marchantes entre los transeuntes. En la
peluquería ve Ud. lo de siempre<a name="FNanchor_42_314" id="FNanchor_42_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_314" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>: objetos de tocador, pelucas y
tupés. Las damas, por su parte, utilizan los servicios de peinadoras que
van a domicilio, o acuden en persona a establecimientos especiales
originarios de París y llamados institutos de belleza.</p>

<p>&mdash;En mis viajes por España he visto muchos establecimientos que
llevaban<a name="FNanchor_43_315" id="FNanchor_43_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_315" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> el nombre genérico de agencias. ¿De qué se ocupan?</p>

<p>&mdash;Son casas que hacen cierto género de servicios; así<a name="FNanchor_44_316" id="FNanchor_44_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_316" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> las agencias
marítimas venden pasajes para los vapores; las de colocaciones
proporcionan sirvientes, empleados, operarios y peones; las de
mensajeros ponen a la disposición del cliente mandaderos para transmitir
recados; las agencias de transportes realizan los servicios que en Norte
América hacen los expresos; las de mudanza se encargan de transportar
muebles cuando se cambia de domicilio; las agencias de alquileres
procuran listas de casas desocupadas; las agencias o casas de cambio
venden y compran moneda extranjera.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Qué nombre se da en la América española a los establecimientos
agrícolas e industriales que explotan la riqueza nacional?</p>

<p>&mdash;Las fincas rurales de labranza o de ganados se llaman estancias,
haciendas, sitios, fundos, ranchos o chacras, variando la designación
según el país y de acuerdo con la naturaleza de la propiedad. La parte
de esos establecimientos que beneficia la leche se conoce con el nombre
de cremería, aunque suele dárseles<a name="page_032" id="page_032"></a> el nombre de <i>tambos</i>. Las estancias
argentinas destinadas exclusivamente a la cría de animales finos o de
raza, o de sangre pura, se distinguen con el nombre especial de cabañas.
Las faenas de carnicería en grande escala llévanse a cabo<a name="FNanchor_45_317" id="FNanchor_45_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_317" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> en los
saladeros y frigoríficos. En este caso me refiero a las operaciones
relacionadas con la exportación de carnes, pues las de consumo local se
llevan a cabo en los mataderos, ya mencionados. La zafra de la caña de
azúcar se realiza en los ingenios, purificándose el producto en las
refinerías. Si las plantaciones de caña se llaman cañaverales y las de
café cafetales, en cambio las de vid se denominan viñedos.<a name="FNanchor_46_318" id="FNanchor_46_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_318" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> La
extracción del mosto, su fermentación y conversión en vino, se lleva a
cabo en las bodegas. Las maderas se benefician y trabajan en los
obrajes; y los metales, que se extraen de las minas, se elaboran en las
fundiciones de hierro, cobre y acero.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Está Ud. trazando nuevos ríos en las Américas?</p>

<p>&mdash;No soy geógrafo ni pretendo serlo.<a name="FNanchor_1_319" id="FNanchor_1_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_319" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Estoy repasando con tinta roja
la parte navegable de los ríos y señalando con líneas azules ciertos
trayectos del ferrocarril; <i>porque</i><a name="FNanchor_2_320" id="FNanchor_2_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_320" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> ha de saber<a name="page_033" id="page_033"></a> Ud.<a name="FNanchor_3_321" id="FNanchor_3_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_321" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> que pienso

latina.</p>

<p>&mdash;Acepto la idea, pues soy muy dado a<a name="FNanchor_5_323" id="FNanchor_5_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_323" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> viajar, y más<a name="FNanchor_6_324" id="FNanchor_6_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_324" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> en esa forma
exenta de<a name="FNanchor_7_325" id="FNanchor_7_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_325" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> molestias. <i>Por</i> lo pronto, haremos el viaje <i>por</i> poco
dinero; no será necesario hacer preparativos para la partida ni escribir
de antemano<a name="FNanchor_8_326" id="FNanchor_8_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_326" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> cartas<a name="FNanchor_9_327" id="FNanchor_9_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_327" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> o poner telegramas<a name="FNanchor_10_328" id="FNanchor_10_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_328" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> a los hoteles para
retener habitaciones.<a name="FNanchor_11_329" id="FNanchor_11_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_329" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>&mdash;Tampoco será preciso consultar la guía de ferrocarriles para saber la
hora de salida y llegada de los trenes. Podremos salir en este mismo
momento.<a name="FNanchor_12_330" id="FNanchor_12_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_330" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>&mdash;Ni se nos dará un comino<a name="FNanchor_13_331" id="FNanchor_13_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_331" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> averiguar si<a name="FNanchor_14_332" id="FNanchor_14_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_332" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> los trenes llegan
adelantados, atrasados o con puntualidad; si son expresos o locales; si
es tarde o si es temprano,<a name="FNanchor_15_333" id="FNanchor_15_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_333" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> si hace buen tiempo<a name="FNanchor_16_334" id="FNanchor_16_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_334" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> o si va a
llover.<a name="FNanchor_17_335" id="FNanchor_17_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_335" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>&mdash;Poco nos cuidaremos<a name="FNanchor_18_336" id="FNanchor_18_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_336" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> de saber cuántos kilos de bagaje<a name="page_034" id="page_034"></a><a name="FNanchor_19_337" id="FNanchor_19_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_337" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> permiten
las compañías con cada boleto<a name="FNanchor_20_338" id="FNanchor_20_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_338" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>; si el tren ha enganchado al
coche-comedor; si hay camas disponibles en los coches dormitorios; y si
las estaciones<a name="FNanchor_21_339" id="FNanchor_21_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_339" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> tienen salas de espera cómodas y con suficiente
calefacción en los pueblos situados a considerable elevación.</p>

<p>&mdash;Me tiene usted listo, y le garantizo que tendrá Ud. un buen compañero
de viaje. Pero antes debo despejar una duda: ¿No tendremos que hacer
casi todo ese viaje a lomo de mula?</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Oh, no! una gran parte lo haremos <i>por</i> ferrocarril; y Ud. se
sorprenderá de lo mucho que<a name="FNanchor_22_340" id="FNanchor_22_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_340" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> andaremos sobre rieles.</p>

<p>&mdash;Me alegro. Por mi parte deseo tomemos cuantos trenes podamos<a name="FNanchor_23_341" id="FNanchor_23_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_341" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> o por
lo menos cuantos nos ofrezcan<a name="FNanchor_24_342" id="FNanchor_24_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_342" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> la perspectiva de un viaje
interesante. Ahora que recuerdo: ¿Están adelantados los trabajos del
ferrocarril panamericano que algún día<a name="FNanchor_25_343" id="FNanchor_25_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_343" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> unirá Nueva York con Buenos
Aires?</p>

<p>&mdash;Ese ferrocarril está muy lejos de hallarse terminado<a name="FNanchor_26_344" id="FNanchor_26_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_344" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> todavía. Pero
en este mapa verá Ud. que las lagunas o claros en el trazado suman una
extensión mucho menor que la de las líneas actualmente en servicio. Lo
malo<a name="FNanchor_27_345" id="FNanchor_27_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_345" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> es que los trechos sin<a name="page_035" id="page_035"></a> terminar<a name="FNanchor_28_346" id="FNanchor_28_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_346" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> se hallan precisamente en
las regiones donde es más difícil la construcción de la vía férrea.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Hasta dónde puede irse por ferrocarril desde nuestro país en
dirección al sur?</p>

<p>&mdash;Como Ud. ve, de cualquier punto de los Estados Unidos es posible
llegar a Ciudad Juárez, término del Ferrocarril Central de Méjico, por
el cual alcanzaríamos<a name="FNanchor_29_347" id="FNanchor_29_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_347" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> el límite con Guatemala, a más de mil millas
de distancia.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Y por vía fluvial? Hay pocos<a name="FNanchor_30_348" id="FNanchor_30_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_348" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> ríos navegables en Méjico y la
América Central, según veo.<a name="FNanchor_31_349" id="FNanchor_31_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_349" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>&mdash;Esos países tienen ríos de montañas los cuales<a name="FNanchor_32_350" id="FNanchor_32_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_350" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> están sujetos al
cambio de caudal resultante de la irregularidad de las lluvias. Por eso
no he señalado como navegables más que<a name="FNanchor_33_351" id="FNanchor_33_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_351" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> el río de las Balsas, parte
del Grijalva, del Usumacinta y del Pánuco, todos en Méjico.</p>

<p>&mdash;Pero estoy impaciente por partir en el viaje que Ud. ha preparado, y
querría salir lo más pronto posible.<a name="FNanchor_34_352" id="FNanchor_34_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_352" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Sírvase Ud. decirme<a name="FNanchor_35_353" id="FNanchor_35_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_353" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>:
¿Iremos por Méjico?</p>

<p>&mdash;Pero antes visitaremos Haití, Santo Domingo y Cuba. La línea <i>Clyde</i>
ofrece un servicio de excursión en torno de<a name="FNanchor_36_354" id="FNanchor_36_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_354" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> la<a name="page_036" id="page_036"></a> isla de Santo
Domingo, y esto nos permitirá visitar las ciudades de Santo Domingo y
Port au Prince, las capitales respectivamente de Santo Domingo y Haití.</p>

<p>Una línea cubana de navegación nos lleva a Santiago de Cuba, de donde
emprenderemos viaje a la Habana, por tren, pasando <i>por</i> las magníficas
selvas del sur de la isla, atravesando luego por sembrados de tabaco y
caña y espléndidas tierras de pastoreo. Desde Santa Clara, continuaremos
el viaje por los Ferrocarriles Unidos de la Habana, hasta esta última
ciudad, a donde<a name="FNanchor_37_355" id="FNanchor_37_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_355" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> llegaremos después de una noche de viaje.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Salen de la Habana vapores para Méjico?</p>

<p>&mdash;Ciertamente, la línea <i>Ward</i> nos lleva allí, haciendo escala en
Progreso, después de un día de navegación, y llegando a Veracruz al cabo
de<a name="FNanchor_38_356" id="FNanchor_38_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_356" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> otros dos.<a name="FNanchor_39_357" id="FNanchor_39_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_357" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Veracruz está en comunicación con toda la red ferroviaria de Méjico,
pero nosotros tomaremos el ferrocarril llamado «de Veracruz al Pacífico»
cuyo término es Salina Cruz, donde hacen escala los vapores que van de
San Francisco de California a Panamá. Uno de esos buques nos lleva de
Salina Cruz a San José, el principal puerto que Guatemala tiene en el
Pacífico.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿<i>Por qué</i><a name="FNanchor_40_358" id="FNanchor_40_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_358" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> no se puede ir por tierra desde Méjico a Guatemala?</p>

<p>&mdash;<i>Porque</i><a name="FNanchor_41_359" id="FNanchor_41_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_359" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> el ferrocarril mejicano no empalma aún con los de
Guatemala, aunque esta última república está <i>por</i> terminar la línea que
habrá de prolongarlo. De modo, pues, que <i>por</i> ahora el acceso a
Guatemala se hace por mar hasta el puerto mencionado de San José.<a name="page_037" id="page_037"></a></p>

<p>Aquí tomamos un tren que en ocho horas nos conduce a Guatemala la Nueva,
capital de<a name="FNanchor_42_360" id="FNanchor_42_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_360" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> la república, después de cruzar una fertilísima región
montañosa en la que abunda toda suerte de<a name="FNanchor_43_361" id="FNanchor_43_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_361" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> plantas silvestres y
árboles de riquísimas maderas.</p>

<p>Podemos continuar nuestro viaje en ferrocarril desde la capital hasta
Puerto Barrios, en la costa del Atlántico, donde llegamos tras de doce
horas de viaje por una región digna de ser conocida<a name="FNanchor_44_362" id="FNanchor_44_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_362" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> <i>por</i> lo
interesante que es<a name="FNanchor_45_363" id="FNanchor_45_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_363" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> para el hombre de negocios a quien le atraen las
empresas agrícolas.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Qué productos descuellan allí?</p>

<p>&mdash;Café, arroz, frutas y fibras, entre otros. Además el viaje es
interesante del punto de vista histórico.<a name="FNanchor_46_364" id="FNanchor_46_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_364" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> El tren pasa por las
ruinas de Quirique, situadas a una milla de distancia de la estación y
que pueden visitarse en coche o a caballo. En Livingston, doce millas al
norte de Puerto Barrios, el paseo en lanchas hasta el lago Izabal ofrece
la oportunidad de admirar un paisaje incomparable, que, no sé <i>por
qué</i><a name="FNanchor_47_365" id="FNanchor_47_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_365" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> es menos visitado de lo que debiera.<a name="FNanchor_48_366" id="FNanchor_48_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_366" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Regresamos a San José, donde podemos tomar uno de los vapores que hacen
el servicio entre los puertos de Guatemala y los de San Salvador. Desde
Acajutla, puerto principal de esta última república, donde
desembarcamos, podemos ir en ferrocarril a la capital, que queda a
sesenta y cinco millas, habiendo un ramal de veinticinco hasta Santa
Ana. El viaje a la capital<a name="page_038" id="page_038"></a> se hace recorriendo una hermosa y
fertilísima región. La ciudad de San Salvador está situada entre
montañas y en el centro de un valle donde prosperan las plantaciones de
índigo.</p>

<p>&mdash;Creo que no se puede ir por ferrocarril desde Guatemala al Salvador.</p>

<p>&mdash;Mucho me lo temo,<a name="FNanchor_49_367" id="FNanchor_49_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_367" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> a menos que<a name="FNanchor_50_368" id="FNanchor_50_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_368" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> esté ya terminada la línea entre
Guatemala y la ciudad de La Unión, en el Salvador; si esto es así,<a name="FNanchor_51_369" id="FNanchor_51_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_369" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
puede ya hacerse por riel el viaje entre Acajutla y la costa del
Atlántico. De modo, pues, que<a name="FNanchor_52_370" id="FNanchor_52_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_370" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> acabada la línea entre Guatemala y
Méjico, será posible viajar en tren desde el Salvador hasta Nueva York.</p>

<p>&mdash;Mirando el mapa, observo que Ud. ha trazado aquí algunas líneas rojas,
indicando<a name="FNanchor_53_371" id="FNanchor_53_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_371" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> la existencia de ríos navegables en San Salvador.</p>

<p>&mdash;Los hay allí <i>por</i> docenas. Son pequeños ríos y lagos que se utilizan
para el transporte de productos y en gran parte para excursiones
campestres. Sin embargo, ninguno de ellos nos lleva a la vecina
república de Honduras, y esta es la razón por la cual<a name="FNanchor_54_372" id="FNanchor_54_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_372" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> deberemos
regresar a Acajutla para tomar el primer vapor que salga<a name="FNanchor_55_373" id="FNanchor_55_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_373" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> para
Amapala, principal puerto de Honduras en el Pacífico, el cual gozará de
una gran prosperidad cuando llegue a este punto el ferrocarril
interoceánico, que arranca de Puerto Cortés en el Atlántico.<a name="page_039" id="page_039"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;¿Cómo se va, pues, a Tegucigalpa, la capital de Honduras?</p>

<p>&mdash;A caballo<a name="FNanchor_56_374" id="FNanchor_56_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_374" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> o en mula y, a trechos<a name="FNanchor_57_375" id="FNanchor_57_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_375" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>, en coche<a name="FNanchor_58_376" id="FNanchor_58_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_376" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> y la travesía
requiere de tres a cuatro días. El país es tan montuoso, que en algunos
lugares no es posible hacer más de tres millas <i>por</i> hora. A veces el
camino está esculpido en la roca; otras, penetra por selvas espesísimas
o cruza dilatados desiertos de arena.</p>

<p>&mdash;En vez de regresar a Amapala, ¿no se puede continuar hasta la cabecera
del ferrocarril que nos llevaría al Atlántico?</p>

<p>&mdash; No, porque habría que hacer una travesía de más de cinco días,<a name="FNanchor_59_377" id="FNanchor_59_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_377" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> lo
cual requeriría dos mulas o cinco caballos....</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Más caballos que mulas<a name="FNanchor_60_378" id="FNanchor_60_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_378" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>?</p>

<p>&mdash;Sí, porque en países montañosos una mula es más resistente que<a name="FNanchor_61_379" id="FNanchor_61_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_379" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> dos
caballos.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿No hay medio de llegar al Atlántico por via fluvial?</p>

<p>&mdash;Si no en su totalidad, la mayor parte de esa travesía<a name="FNanchor_62_380" id="FNanchor_62_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_380" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> puede
hacerse por agua; pues como usted ve, el río Ulúa, que desemboca en el
Atlántico, se comunica con el lago Yojoz por medio del río Blanco. Por
lo tanto es preferible que regresemos a Amapala.</p>

<p>El viaje de Amapala hasta Corinto, puerto de Nicaragua, nos permitirá
admirar el volcán Coseguina. La costa que tocamos es la más fértil de
Nicaragua,<a name="FNanchor_63_381" id="FNanchor_63_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_381" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> y en ella se produce en abundancia<a name="page_040" id="page_040"></a> el café y otros dos
productos<a name="FNanchor_64_382" id="FNanchor_64_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_382" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> importantes: el cacao y el maíz. De Corinto un ferrocarril
nos lleva a las ciudades de León, Managua (que es la capital) y Granada.</p>

<p>Con la excepción de<a name="FNanchor_65_383" id="FNanchor_65_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_383" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> un pequeño trecho en las montañas, el tren
recorre una comarca casi llana, dedicada principalmente a la agricultura
y a la ganadería. Desde Granada, en la costa del lago Nicaragua, podemos
continuar la travesía en vapor, primero por el lago y luego por el río
San Juan que es su desagüe en el Atlántico.</p>

<p>&mdash;Veo que Nicaragua ofrece fácil tráfico fluvial entre ambas costas.</p>

<p>&mdash;Y esa ha sido la base del proyecto de canalización en Nicaragua. Hoy
puede admirarse<a name="FNanchor_66_384" id="FNanchor_66_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_384" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> los trabajos ya realizados en el San Juan, <i>por</i> el
lado del Atlántico. Por el del Pacífico, un canal entre la costa y el
lago habría completado la ruta por agua.</p>

<p>Si en nuestro viaje fluvial hubiéramos llegado a Greytown, en la
desembocadura del San Juan, sería fácil<a name="FNanchor_67_385" id="FNanchor_67_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_385" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> pasar a Puerto Limón en
Costa Rica en uno de los pequeños vapores que hacen la travesía entre
los puertos marítimos y los fluviales. El viaje de siete horas en un
excelente ferrocarril entre Puerto Limón (notable por su actividad
comercial relacionada con el comercio de la banana y del caucho) y la
capital, San José, es excepcionalmente cómodo y se considera a la vez
como<a name="FNanchor_68_386" id="FNanchor_68_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_386" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> uno de los más atrayentes que ofrece la América latina, como<a name="page_041" id="page_041"></a>
que<a name="FNanchor_69_387" id="FNanchor_69_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_387" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> se realiza <i>por</i> entre montañas. De San José podemos prolongar
nuestra excursión <i>por</i> cinco horas más hasta Punta Arenas, el principal
puerto de Costa Rica sobre el Pacífico y lugar de residencias preferido
por las clases acomodadas. Dicho puerto se halla en una región rica en
perlas y próximo a la famosa mina de Trinidad, a la vez que<a name="FNanchor_70_388" id="FNanchor_70_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_388" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> es el
centro de la producción y exportación del café.</p>

<p>&mdash;Veo que Costa Rica también tiene ríos navegables.</p>

<p>&mdash;Nada menos que<a name="FNanchor_71_389" id="FNanchor_71_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_389" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> diez y seis; pero lo son en cortas distancias y por
embarcaciones de poco calado. El río San Juan, ya nombrado y que sirve
de límite con Nicaragua, es uno de los más utilizados.</p>

<p>Regresando a Puerto Limón por el mismo ferrocarril, cualquiera de los
buques de la «Flota Blanca» que vienen del norte y hacen escala en ese
punto, nos lleva a Cristóbal, en la cabecera norte del canal de Panamá.</p>

<p>Dos caminos se nos ofrecen aquí para entrar a la América del Sur: el del
Mar Caribe y el del Pacífico, este último en vapores de bandera chilena
o peruana.<a name="FNanchor_72_390" id="FNanchor_72_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_390" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> En el primer caso nuestro destino es Cartagena; en el
segundo Buenaventura, ambos puertos de Colombia.</p>

<p>&mdash;Me atrae el viaje por Cartagena, pues he oído alabar las excursiones
por el río Magdalena y el Cauca.</p>

<p>&mdash;Pues vamos allá.<a name="FNanchor_73_391" id="FNanchor_73_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_391" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Como Ud. ve, el río es una de las más<a name="page_042" id="page_042"></a> grandes
vías fluviales del continente. Aquí navegan buques de un calado de
cuatro pies.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Entran al río los buques que hacen el servicio entre los puertos de
la costa oceánica?</p>

<p>&mdash;No pueden hacerlo<a name="FNanchor_74_392" id="FNanchor_74_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_392" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> porque una barra de fango, formada en la
desembocadura del río, impide la entrada de los transatlánticos al río,
a la vez que la salida al mar de los vapores del río. Por eso ve Ud.
aquí un ferrocarril comunicando el puerto fluvial de Barranquilla, con
el marítimo de Puerto Colombia. Y verá muchos más, porque en Colombia el
tráfico terrestre está bien combinado con el fluvial.</p>

<p>&mdash;También observo otras líneas que, al parecer,<a name="FNanchor_75_393" id="FNanchor_75_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_393" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> no corresponden con
los ferrocarriles ni con los ríos.</p>

<p>&mdash;Son caminos de mulas.</p>

<p>&mdash;Veo que el Cauca, afluente del Magdalena, es también navegable.</p>

<p>&mdash;Facilita el tráfico entre Bogotá y la costa del Pacífico.</p>

<p>&mdash;Para ello habrá sin duda que bajar por el Magdalena hasta su
confluencia con el Cauca y remontar éste hasta donde nos lo permita su
profundidad.</p>

<p>&mdash;Dejando el Cauca, el viaje se prosigue en mula hasta Cali, y por
ferrocarril hasta Buenaventura, donde tomaremos el vapor de la <i>Pacific
Steam Navigation Company</i>,<a name="FNanchor_76_394" id="FNanchor_76_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_394" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> con rumbo a<a name="FNanchor_77_395" id="FNanchor_77_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_395" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Guayaquil.</p>

<p>Entremos a Guayaquil por el golfo de ese nombre y seguimos<a name="page_043" id="page_043"></a> luego por un
río que en él desemboca y cuyo valle estará completamente sumergido, si
<i>por</i> acaso llegamos en la época de las lluvias.</p>

<p>Desde el término de esta navegación el viaje a los Andes se continúa en
mula, ascendiendo la falda hasta el Paso del Arenal, por donde se entra
al alto valle central del Ecuador, que nos lleva en dirección a Quito,
teniendo a la vista el Chimborazo. El círculo de nuestra gira comenzada
en Guayaquil se cierra recorriendo en ferrocarril las trescientas millas
que separan a Quito de aquel punto.</p>

<p>De Guayaquil al Callao los vapores de las dos compañías sudamericanas
ponen cuatro días. Lima, la ciudad de los Reyes,<a name="FNanchor_78_396" id="FNanchor_78_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_396" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> está sólo a pocos
minutos del Callao, y el trayecto se recorre en tranvía o en
ferrocarril. En el Perú el ferrocarril de Oroya, el más alto del mundo,
ofrece una oportunidad singular para conocer los Andes y estudiar la
labor de sus minas. Este ferrocarril llegará un día hasta los
tributarios del Amazonas; pero por ahora, como Ud. ve, sólo alcanza
lugares un poco al norte de las famosas minas de Cerro de Pasco. Un
ramal austral llega hasta Ayacucho, a menos de 200 millas del Cuzco.</p>

<p>&mdash;Veo que la gran red de ferrocarriles de la parte austral de Sur
América extiende una de sus líneas hasta las proximidades de Cuzco.</p>

<p>&mdash;Sí; y observe Ud. que cuando los rieles hayan suprimido esa distancia
de doscientas millas, podrá viajarse por ferrocarril desde Buenos Aires
a Lima.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Cómo<a name="FNanchor_79_397" id="FNanchor_79_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_397" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> puede hacerse hoy esa parte del viaje?<a name="page_044" id="page_044"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;En mula o en diligencia. Pero sigamos nuestro viaje. De Cuzco el
ferrocarril nos lleva hasta Puno, sobre el lago Titicaca, a 12,500 pies
de elevación; cruzamos las aguas del lago en un vapor moderno, de mil
toneladas, que nos lleva a Guaqui, en la costa boliviana; y de allí
llegamos fácilmente en tren o diligencia a La Paz, teniendo a la vista
el Illimani.</p>

<p>Si en lugar de atravesar el Titicaca hubiéramos continuado el viaje en
tren por un ramal que se desprende en dirección al sur desde Juliaca,
habríamos podido llegar a Arequipa (cerca de la cual se halla el
Observatorio de Harvard), y de allí a Mollendo, puerto del Perú, por
donde pasa una gran parte del comercio exterior de Bolivia.</p>

<p>De La Paz, situada en la proximidad de los valles que producen ricos
cafés, así como la coca y la cinchona, o árbol de la quina, podemos
dirigirnos, sea al puerto chileno de Arica, por el ferrocarril del
Estado, sea al de Antofagasta, cerca del cual<a name="FNanchor_80_398" id="FNanchor_80_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_398" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> están las fundiciones
de minerales más grandes de Sud América. Esta última línea que se llama
de Antofagasta y Bolivia, nos permite visitar las minas de estaño de
Oruro y la celebrada ciudad de Potosí.</p>

<p>En Urquín se desprende un ramal que está para unirse<a name="FNanchor_81_399" id="FNanchor_81_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_399" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> con el
ferrocarril boliviano y más al sur con los ferrocarriles argentinos. La
parte <i>por</i> terminar se recorre sin embargo en diligencia.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Y los campos de nitrato?</p>

<p>&mdash;Quedan en Iquique, y para visitarlos habría que elegir las líneas de
La Paz al puerto de Arica, llegando a Iquique por agua.<a name="page_045" id="page_045"></a></p>

<p>Desde Antofagasta, y aun desde Iquique, el viaje al sur puede
continuarse en ferrocarril por más de mil quinientas millas por el
centro de Chile, hasta Puerto Montt. A propósito, le hago notar a Ud.
que hoy día es posible en Sud América hacer un viaje en tren de 3300
millas, equivalente al de Nueva York a San Francisco de California.</p>

<p>&mdash;¡<i>Por</i> vida de...! No tenía idea de tales progresos,<a name="FNanchor_82_400" id="FNanchor_82_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_400" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> lo confieso.</p>

<p>&mdash;Para ello, puede Ud. salir de Puerto Montt, que queda como Ud. ve, a
unos mil kilómetros de Valparaíso, y continuar su viaje hasta Buenos
Aires; de allí es posible seguir hacia el norte, cruzar los ríos Paraná
y Uruguay en ferribote y empalmar con la línea San Paulo y Río Grande,
que termina en Río Janeiro, y que dentro de poco llegará a Pernambuco.</p>

<p>&mdash;Es sorprendente. Y veo que también se puede ir de Puerto Montt a La
Paz, en Bolivia.</p>

<p>&mdash;<i>Por</i> cierto. Y este es el trayecto que a la inversa podremos elegir
para nuestro viaje imaginario, sólo que nos apearemos en Concepción,
situado en la rica región carbonífera de Chile, desde donde
emprenderemos el viaje marítimo a Punta Arenas, en el estrecho de
Magallanes, la ciudad más austral del mundo. Aquí nos vemos rodeados de
montañas, selvas umbrosas, ventisqueros y hielos flotantes.</p>

<p>Nuestro vapor nos lleva de Punta Arenas directamente a Montevideo; pero
otros hacen escala en los puertos argentinos, o a lo menos en Bahía
Blanca, de donde podríamos continuar el viaje por tierra en el
Ferrocarril del Sur de Buenos Aires. La ciudad de este nombre es el
centro ferrocarrilero y de navegación fluvial más importante de Sud
América. De<a name="page_046" id="page_046"></a> aquí es posible, por lo tanto, continuar la gira de muchas
maneras, sea llegando a La Paz en Bolivia, después de pasar por las
ciudades argentinas de Rosario, Tucumán, Salta y Jujuy y recorrer en
diligencia la pequeña solución de continuidad mencionada anteriormente,
sea regresando a Valparaíso, sea, en fin, pasando a la Asunción, capital
del Paraguay, o a Río Janeiro en el Brasil.</p>

<p>&mdash;En efecto, observo que su mapa muestra un enorme sistema fluvial cuyos
componentes convergen al Plata. ¿Pueden entrar tierra adentro los
vapores de ultramar, navegando por los ríos Paraná y Uruguay?</p>

<p>&mdash;Sí tal. La ciudad de Corrientes que ve Ud. aquí, a cosa de<a name="FNanchor_83_401" id="FNanchor_83_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_401" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> mil
kilómetros de la desembocadura del Paraná, puede recibir vapores
transatlánticos en las épocas de las crecidas periódicas del río.
Rosario, mucho más cerca de Buenos Aires, tiene su puerto dragado hasta
una profundidad mínima de 6.90 metros en marea baja, lo que le permite
recibir grandes transatlánticos.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Pueden también pasar éstos por el río Uruguay?</p>

<p>&mdash;Hasta Concordia. Después puede navegarse el río, pero por
embarcaciones muy pequeñas, hasta Ibicuy en el Brasil y hasta Cuareim
por un afluente del río. En cambio, volviendo al Paraná, que dejamos en
Corrientes, vea Ud. como continúa la línea roja hacia el Paraguay por un
lado y el Alto Paraná por el otro.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Hasta dónde se navega el Alto Paraná?</p>

<p>&mdash;Hasta Puerto Aguirre, cerca de Iguazú, aunque por buques de muy poco
calado.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Y el Paraguay?</p>

<p>&mdash;Por él puede viajarse hasta la Asunción, durante todo el<a name="page_047" id="page_047"></a> año, en
buques de tres metros de calado; <i>por</i> más que recibe buques de 4.20 en
épocas de crecida. En condiciones favorables, los buques de 1.50 m. de
calado ascienden hasta Matto Grosso, en el Brasil, a 3200 kilómetros de
la desembocadura.</p>

<p>Ud. ve, pues, que Buenos Aires ofrece al viajero un sinnúmero de
conexiones. Es éste, además, un gran puerto marítimo de donde parten más
de cincuenta líneas de navegación para Europa y Estados Unidos, cuyos
vapores hacen escalas en Montevideo, Santos, Río Janeiro, Bahía y
Pernambuco.</p>

<p>En Bahía puede tomarse uno de los cómodos vapores que costean la parte
norte del Brasil, <i>por</i> la oportunidad que ofrece de visitar las
ciudades de Ceará y Pará, donde sería posible continuar el viaje por el
Amazonas hasta Iquitos, en el Perú, en los vapores de la línea Booth.</p>

<p>&mdash;Veo que Ud. ha señalado de rojo la gran ruta del Amazonas hasta el
Perú.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿No sabía Ud. que gracias al Amazonas, pueden entrar a la ciudad
peruana de Iquitos los vapores del Atlántico?</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Es en verdad maravilloso! Y a propósito de<a name="FNanchor_84_402" id="FNanchor_84_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_402" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> trayectos
interesantes, ¿es cierto que por el Amazonas y sus afluentes puede
navegarse hasta el mar de las Antillas? <i>Por</i> mucho que pensase, no
sabría<a name="FNanchor_85_403" id="FNanchor_85_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_403" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> cómo puede hacerse ese viaje.</p>

<p>&mdash;Ya verá Ud. eso bien claro aquí: Entra Ud. por el Amazonas; sigue por
el río Negro, luego remonta este río durante algunos días hasta que
llega al río Casiquiari por donde entra Ud. al Orinoco y por éste al mar
de las Antillas. El viaje se hace cómodamente, aunque por cierto en
buques de poco calado.<a name="page_048" id="page_048"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;Me parece notar aquí que mediante un corto canal podría unirse el
Amazonas con el sistema del Plata.</p>

<p>&mdash;Precisamente. Remontando el Tapajos hasta sus fuentes, bastaría un
canal para unir sus aguas con el Paraguay a la altura de Cuyabá; desde
allí puede navegarse hasta Buenos Aires en embarcaciones de calado cada
vez mayor. De modo que no es difícil que<a name="FNanchor_86_404" id="FNanchor_86_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_404" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> algún día se navegue
cómodamente desde la boca del Orinoco hasta la del Plata.</p>

<p>Pero volviendo al Orinoco, aquí puede Ud. ver la parte navegable de ese
río. Este punto representa Puerto España, con el cual se hace casi todo
el comercio fluvial de Venezuela.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Y este otro lugar más al sur?</p>

<p>&mdash;Ese es Ciudad Bolívar, a dos días de viaje, remontando el río. Aquí se
hace una parada de tres días, y la carga y los pasajeros se trasbordan a
lanchas o vapores de poco calado, sea para continuar por el Orinoco o
por su afluente el Apure, hasta donde lo permita la profundidad del
agua.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Según eso, en algunas estaciones del año se puede avanzar más que en
otras?</p>

<p>&mdash;Sí señor; <i>por</i> enero y febrero, o más exactamente, entre diciembre y
abril la navegación en las partes altas del Orinoco está interrumpida.</p>

<p>&mdash;Suponiendo que hubiéramos<a name="FNanchor_87_405" id="FNanchor_87_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_405" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> llegado a la boca del Orinoco, ¿cómo
completaríamos nuestra gira desde allí?</p>

<p>&mdash;Muy fácilmente; pasando a la isla inglesa de Trinidad, desde donde
visitaríamos las ciudades y puertos de Venezuela, que se hallan casi
todos en la costa del mar Caribe. De la<a name="page_049" id="page_049"></a> Guayra o Puerto Cabello
regresaríamos por último a Nueva York en un vapor de la Red D Line.</p>

<p>&mdash;<i>Por</i> más que se diga,<a name="FNanchor_88_406" id="FNanchor_88_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_406" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> mucho puede aprenderse en un viaje ... por
el mapa.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>V.&mdash;EL OBRERO EN LA AMÉRICA LATINA<br /><br />
<small><i>Equivalents of <b>Who</b> and <b>Whom</b></i></small><br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h3>

<p>&mdash;Confieso que mis ideas respecto de las condiciones del trabajo en el
resto de América nunca fueron claras. Como tengo a Ud. por un hombre<a name="FNanchor_1_407" id="FNanchor_1_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_407" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
versado en asuntos económicos, le suplico me diga quién es el obrero
en<a name="FNanchor_2_408" id="FNanchor_2_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_408" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> la América latina, a qué raza o nacionalidad pertenece y cuál es
su estado social.<a name="FNanchor_3_409" id="FNanchor_3_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_409" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>&mdash;El que quiera<a name="FNanchor_4_410" id="FNanchor_4_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_410" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> comprender perfectamente la situación de las clases
trabajadoras en la América latina debe ante todo darse cuenta de este
hecho: Que la composición etnológica de la población varía en esos
países según se vaya<a name="FNanchor_5_411" id="FNanchor_5_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_411" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> del trópico, donde abunda el indio,<a name="FNanchor_6_412" id="FNanchor_6_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_412" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> a las
zonas templadas y frías donde acaso no se encuentra un solo indígena.<a name="FNanchor_7_413" id="FNanchor_7_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_413" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Por otra parte, las<a name="page_050" id="page_050"></a> comarcas situadas sobre el Atlántico reciben más
inmigración europea que las situadas sobre el Pacífico.</p>

<p>&mdash;Voy comprendiendo. El indio disminuye en número de norte a sur y el
europeo, de este a oeste. Supongo que el indio y el mestizo, donde esas
clases existen, sirven en los trabajos rudos....</p>

<p>&mdash;El obrero que Ud. ve<a name="FNanchor_8_414" id="FNanchor_8_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_414" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> en el trópico es el indio, a quien<a name="FNanchor_9_415" id="FNanchor_9_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_415" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> se le
encomiendan los trabajos pesados y sin cuya ayuda no podría prosperar el
blanco,<a name="FNanchor_10_416" id="FNanchor_10_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_416" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> el cual,<a name="FNanchor_11_417" id="FNanchor_11_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_417" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> por su parte, ofrece a aquél la oportunidad de
educarse y de mejorar su condición económica. Naturalmente, el indio que
emplean las administraciones<a name="FNanchor_12_418" id="FNanchor_12_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_418" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> industriales es el manso y
semicivilizado. Donde hay indios, el europeo no puede medrar, pues la
vida de éste reclama un salario más alto que el que al indígena se paga.
Pero donde el indio es escaso, como en el Uruguay, en el centro y sur de
la Argentina y en el centro de Chile, el inmigrante europeo es el que
desempeña las faenas rudas en los saladeros y frigoríficos, en la
construcción de vías férreas, en la edificación y sobre todo en la
agricultura.</p>

<p>A consecuencia también de la escasez de indios, el nativo civilizado,
blanco, inteligente e industrioso, realiza las labores mencionadas. Pero
el nativo a que me refiero, por tener un carácter altivo e
independiente, prefiere sobre todo las actividades relacionadas con la
cría del ganado.<a name="FNanchor_13_419" id="FNanchor_13_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_419" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Estas labores tienen extraordinario atractivo sobre
esos hombres de los campos, como lo prueba el gran número de <i>gauchos</i> o
peones criollos<a name="page_051" id="page_051"></a> en las haciendas ganaderas del Uruguay, Argentina y el
sur del Brasil.</p>

<p>Las labores agrícolas, como ya he dicho,<a name="FNanchor_14_420" id="FNanchor_14_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_420" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> atraen sobre todo a los
europeos. Así, encuentra Ud. alemanes en Río Grande (Brasil), suizos en
Mercedes (Uruguay), polacos, judíos, italianos y vascos en Misiones,
Entre Ríos, Santa Fe y Buenos Aires (Argentina) y alemanes en
Concepción, Valdivia y Victoria (Chile).</p>

<p>En la costa del Pacífico, según lo he hecho notar ya, el europeo no
abunda y por esta razón el nativo ocupa su lugar en las tareas
agrícolas, como ocurre en Chile. En el Perú la ausencia de europeos,
agravada por la escasez de nativos y por el hecho de que éstos prefieren
entregarse a las faenas de la recolección del caucho, ha hecho menester
acudir al inmigrante chino, quien por sus hábitos de frugalidad hace
casi imposible la competencia a los obreros europeos. Como se sabe, de
todos los obreros civilizados, el chino es el que<a name="FNanchor_15_421" id="FNanchor_15_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_421" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> más bajo salario
exige.</p>

<p>En Centro América se siente también la falta de braceros, al punto que
en Honduras el fruto de los cafetos se pierde a veces por no haber quien
lo recoja. Para la recolección de la banana o plátano, se importan en
Centro América negros de Jamaica.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Y las industrias manuales?</p>

<p>&mdash;Las ejercen los europeos, particularmente en el lado del Atlántico. En
los países adonde la inmigración europea acude en menor número, los
criollos se dedican a la industria, como<a name="page_052" id="page_052"></a> ocurre en Chile y el Perú,
especialmente en este último país, donde los salarios han subido a
consecuencia de<a name="FNanchor_16_422" id="FNanchor_16_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_422" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> la falta de obreros expertos en la industria. Me
refiero a los oficios menudos y los relacionados con las artes gráficas.
La gran industria está todavía escasamente representada y se relaciona
con la preparación de productos alimenticios helados y elaboración del
cuero.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Sabe Ud. cómo vive el extranjero en la América latina?</p>

<p>&mdash;No he estado jamás<a name="FNanchor_1_423" id="FNanchor_1_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_423" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> en esos países y no sé nada<a name="FNanchor_2_424" id="FNanchor_2_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_424" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> de la vida en
ellos.</p>

<p>&mdash;Entonces no extrañará Ud. ni se molestará si le doy una explicación
algo extensa sobre este punto. El extranjero que llega a la América
latina pocas veces<a name="FNanchor_3_425" id="FNanchor_3_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_425" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> es un viajero de paso, casi nunca un turista. A
menudo es un colono nuevo, un empleado o un agente comercial. Y no es
raro que el inmigrante pase todo el resto de su vida en el país
adonde<a name="FNanchor_4_426" id="FNanchor_4_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_426" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> se encamina y forme en él un nuevo hogar.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Gozan los extranjeros de especiales derechos?<a name="page_053" id="page_053"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;No, por cierto. No disfrutan de ninguna<a name="FNanchor_5_427" id="FNanchor_5_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_427" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> ventaja especial, pero en
cambio tampoco se les niega ninguno de los derechos que tienen los
ciudadanos, excepto, naturalmente, el de votar. Pero ninguno se queja<a name="FNanchor_6_428" id="FNanchor_6_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_428" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
de esta limitación, pues nada les impide expresar sus ideas por medio de
los periódicos que publican.</p>

<p>&mdash;A propósito de esos periódicos, diré a Ud. que aunque muchos de ellos
son órganos autorizados, no intervienen casi nada en la política local,
ni tienen en la opinión pública el mismo peso que<a name="FNanchor_7_429" id="FNanchor_7_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_429" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> los periódicos
nacionales.</p>

<p>&mdash;No por eso, me imagino,<a name="FNanchor_8_430" id="FNanchor_8_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_430" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> son los extranjeros tenidos en menos o mal
recibidos por los nativos....</p>

<p>&mdash;En modo alguno.<a name="FNanchor_9_431" id="FNanchor_9_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_431" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Sin duda en todas partes se ven personas que no
desean tener trato con nadie, que nunca reciben extraños y menos
extranjeros en sus casas; que a nadie hacen siquiera<a name="FNanchor_10_432" id="FNanchor_10_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_432" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> el ofrecimiento
de su<a name="FNanchor_11_433" id="FNanchor_11_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_433" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> amistad. Esas personas no sientan nunca un extranjero<a name="FNanchor_12_434" id="FNanchor_12_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_434" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> a su
mesa. En cambio, hay otras para quienes una carta de recomendación o de
simple presentación basta para considerar al recién llegado como un
amigo.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Basta con eso para ser recibido en la intimidad de la familia?</p>

<p>&mdash;No siempre, claro está. Pero cuando a Ud. le dicen: «Ya<a name="page_054" id="page_054"></a> sabe que esta
casa es suya»<a name="FNanchor_13_435" id="FNanchor_13_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_435" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> o «esta casa está a su disposición,»<a name="FNanchor_14_436" id="FNanchor_14_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_436" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> no dude Ud.
que su presencia les es grata.</p>

<p>&mdash;Me han dicho, sin embargo, que el recién venido nunca penetra<a name="FNanchor_15_437" id="FNanchor_15_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_437" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
completamente en el círculo íntimo de la familia.</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Oh, nada de éso!<a name="FNanchor_16_438" id="FNanchor_16_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_438" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> No lo crea Ud.</p>

<p>&mdash;Me cuentan que ni habiendo entrado<a name="FNanchor_17_439" id="FNanchor_17_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_439" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> en la familia por casamiento,
llegó un extranjero a ser completamente de los íntimos. Se le excluía
por el hecho mismo de<a name="FNanchor_18_440" id="FNanchor_18_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_440" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> ser extranjero. Pero tal vez ese sea un caso
aislado.</p>

<p>Pasando a la faz política de este asunto, ¿no cree Ud. que a veces se
duda de la lealtad de los extranjeros para con el país donde se hallan?</p>

<p>&mdash;De ningún modo.<a name="FNanchor_19_441" id="FNanchor_19_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_441" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Los extranjeros celebran sus fiestas nacionales
acompañando el regocijo con expansiones patrióticas. No veo razón alguna
para coartarles ese derecho. Los extranjeros tienen además sus
sociedades; pero nadie cree que con eso comprometan la homogeneidad de
la sociedad en que viven. Es cierto que en tierra extranjera los
sentimientos patrióticos del hombre están más exaltados que nunca; pero
también es verdad que los extranjeros suelen defender con más ahinco que
nadie los ataques a su patria adoptiva.</p>

<p>&mdash;Habla Ud. de fiestas. ¿Se refiere Ud. a las religiosas?</p>

<p>&mdash;No tanto a ésas como a las cívicas<a name="FNanchor_20_442" id="FNanchor_20_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_442" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>; verbigracia las del<a name="page_055" id="page_055"></a> cuatro y
catorce de julio o el veinte de septiembre, celebradas por los
norteamericanos, franceses e italianos respectivamente. En cuanto a las
fiestas religiosas,<a name="FNanchor_21_443" id="FNanchor_21_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_443" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> la inversión de las estaciones les quitaría
mucho de su carácter y significado. No sería nada apropiado celebrar la
navidad cuando hace más calor que nunca. ¿Y habría nada más extemporáneo
que hacer la procesión de Corpus después de recogida la cosecha? Tampoco
sería lógico celebrar las pascuas en otoño.</p>

<p>&mdash;Ud. me dice que el sentimiento hacia el extranjero es cordial; sin
embargo, he oído decir que los naturales les ponen motes despectivos.</p>

<p>&mdash;Ese es un hecho universal, que en este caso exterioriza cierta
inofensiva vanidad por parte del<a name="FNanchor_22_444" id="FNanchor_22_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_444" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> nativo más bien que<a name="FNanchor_23_445" id="FNanchor_23_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_445" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> un
sentimiento hostil. Durante el <i>coloniaje</i> se llamaba chapetones y
cachupines a los españoles en América, y de aquí que<a name="FNanchor_24_446" id="FNanchor_24_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_446" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> «chapetonada»
signifique bisoñería, falta de experiencia en los usos del país. La
misma palabra «gringo», procedente tal vez de <i>greenhorn</i>, probaría que
lo más chocante a los ojos del nativo no es la calidad de extranjero
sino la impericia del forastero, la dificultad que encuentra para
«acriollarse».</p>

<p>&mdash;El sentimiento localista debe de ser muy aguzado.</p>

<p>&mdash;Lo es hasta entre los mismos naturales. Los nativos de las ciudades
ridiculizan a la gente de los campos, llamándolas<a name="page_056" id="page_056"></a> paisanos, fuereños,
orilleros, etc., mientras éstos llaman a aquéllos puebleros y pueblanos,
designaciones no exentas de burla, sobre todo cuando el forastero, por
su inexperiencia, se atrae los dictados de maturrango y de chambón.</p>

<p>&mdash;Supongo además que los criollos reciben denominaciones diferentes
según su procedencia.</p>

<p>&mdash;Infinitas. Arribeños son en Chile los habitantes de la costa del sur y
abajeños los de la del norte. Calentanos se denominan en Colombia los
habitantes de tierra caliente, o sean las costas, valles bajos y
llanuras del sur y el oriente. Jarocho es el campesino de Veracruz,
llanero es en Venezuela el habitante de la llanura, collas en Bolivia
son los moradores de la altiplanicie, y pampinos en Chile los
procedentes de las pampas del norte.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿No se distinguen los nativos con nombres especiales según las razas a
que pertenecen?</p>

<p>&mdash;Sin duda; el hijo de india y blanco se llama cholo o chino; el de
negra y blanco, mulato y el de negro e india, zambo. El nombre de chino
también se aplica en algunas partes al hijo de mulata y negro, y en
otras al de indio y zambo. La raza amarilla ha introducido el adjetivo
canaca. Además la condición social impone ciertas denominaciones. Ya
sabe Ud. que pelados en Méjico y rotos en Chile son nombres dados a la
gente del pueblo bajo.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Cuál es el género de trabajos que los extranjeros prefieren según su
nacionalidad?</p>

<p>&mdash;Le diré a Ud. El francés,<a name="FNanchor_25_447" id="FNanchor_25_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_447" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> el español y el italiano prefieren
trabajar como mozos y camareros en los hoteles, restaurantes, cafés,
fondas y otros establecimientos semejantes. Los ingleses no entienden
nada de eso.</p>

<p>En las casas de modas y en otras tiendas donde se venden<a name="page_057" id="page_057"></a> artículos
relacionados con el vestido de la mujer, no es casualidad el que las
modistas<a name="FNanchor_26_448" id="FNanchor_26_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_448" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> y costureras sean casi siempre francesas; aunque entre las
muchas que se ganan la vida<a name="FNanchor_27_449" id="FNanchor_27_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_449" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> trabajando en estas labores,<a name="FNanchor_28_450" id="FNanchor_28_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_450" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> así
como en los talleres de bordados, encajes y flores artificiales, no
faltan las obreras aprendizas y oficialas criollas.</p>

<p>En las grandes empresas dominan los ingleses, sobre todo en la América
del Sur. En el caso de las compañías de ferrocarriles, de tranvías, de
navegación, de iluminación, de seguros sobre la vida, contra incendios,
o contra accidentes, ninguno de los directores<a name="FNanchor_29_451" id="FNanchor_29_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_451" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> generales está en la
América latina; allí hay sólo directorios locales constituidos por
ingleses e hijos del país.<a name="FNanchor_30_452" id="FNanchor_30_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_452" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Por lo general los gerentes de estas
empresas son también ingleses. Es claro que las oficinas relacionadas
con esas compañías dan empleo a muchos europeos, quienes ocupan los
cargos de jefes de oficina, tenedores de libros, contadores,
inspectores, encargados de las mesas de entradas, escribientes,
taquígrafos, dactilógrafos o mecanógrafos y hasta porteros y otros
empleos de inferior categoría.</p>

<p>En las empresas de ferrocarril, algunos jefes de estación son
extranjeros, pero los empleados del escritorio en las mismas suelen ser
jóvenes hijos del país. Los maquinistas y fogoneros o foguistas, los
guardatrenes, guardaagujas, guardabarreras y mayorales son también
criollos.</p>

<p>En otras empresas industriales que son producto del capital extranjero,
los empleados de las oficinas son jóvenes hijos de familias del país,
mientras que los obreros, peones y operarios<a name="page_058" id="page_058"></a> son por lo general
inmigrantes españoles o italianos. Ningún<a name="FNanchor_31_453" id="FNanchor_31_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_453" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> inglés se ve entre ellos.
Los contramaestres, capataces, regentes, jefes de taller o de cuadrilla,
los dependientes principales de casas de comercio, suelen ser de la
nacionalidad de los directores principales de las empresas.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Cómo se distribuye el trabajo en las oficinas o negociados de la
administración pública?</p>

<p>&mdash;No existe aún la ley del servicio civil; pero en algunos países, sólo
los ciudadanos nativos o naturalizados pueden ocupar empleos en la
administración pública.</p>

<p>&mdash;Supongo que la administración puede ser nacional, del estado (o
provincial) y municipal.</p>

<p>&mdash;Precisamente. En lo nacional<a name="FNanchor_32_454" id="FNanchor_32_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_454" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> las reparticiones públicas se agrupan
por ministerios, que los hay de<a name="FNanchor_33_455" id="FNanchor_33_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_455" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Instrucción Pública, Justicia,
Interior o de la Gobernación, del Tesoro o de Hacienda; de Fomento o de
Agricultura, Industria y Comercio; de Guerra; de Marina; de Relaciones
Exteriores, de Obras Públicas, de Comunicaciones, etc.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿No se llama &lsquo;secretarios&rsquo; a los ministros como en los Estados Unidos?</p>

<p>&mdash;En algunos países se les da el nombre de Secretarios de Estado; los
funcionarios que les siguen en rango son subsecretarios.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Cómo se dividen esos ramos administrativamente?</p>

<p>&mdash;En Departamentos, Direcciones, Divisiones, Negociados, Inspecciones,
Oficinas. Los empleados que los atienden reciben diversos nombres como
jefe, segundo jefe, secretario general, tesorero, contador, oficial
mayor, oficial primero, segundo, etc.;<a name="page_059" id="page_059"></a> escribiente, ayudante. El
personal de servicio está constituido por un mayordomo, porteros,
ordenanzas, mensajeros, peones, etc. En algunas oficinas además del
personal administrador hay un personal técnico en los ramos agrícolas,
industriales, de construcción, etc., según el caso.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Cómo se denomina las diversas partes de una oficina?</p>

<p>&mdash;Tiene Ud. salas de recibo para el público, mesa de entradas y salidas,
despacho del jefe y otros funcionarios superiores, secretaría,
tesorería, contaduría, depósito, oficinas técnicas, archivo, etc.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>VII.&mdash;CORRETAJE<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h3>

<p>&mdash;Pienso enviar un hijo mío<a name="FNanchor_1_456" id="FNanchor_1_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_456" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> a Sud América a fin de que se familiarice
con los métodos comerciales de esos países. Quisiera hacer de él un
corredor, un perito comercial, agente o cosa parecida.<a name="FNanchor_2_457" id="FNanchor_2_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_457" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>&mdash;Le advierto que el aspirante a corredor debe haber residido
previamente durante cierto tiempo en el país donde desee ejercer el
corretaje. Algunos países exigen además que haya ejercido el comercio de
por sí o en sociedad<a name="FNanchor_3_458" id="FNanchor_3_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_458" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> en una casa al por mayor.</p>

<p>&mdash;Se me dice que se le ofrecería una plaza de tenedor de libros en
Buenos Aires o en Montevideo.</p>

<p>&mdash;Después de haber residido un año en la Argentina habría<a name="page_060" id="page_060"></a> cumplido con
el requisito de residencia que impone esa nación. ¿Qué edad tiene<a name="FNanchor_4_459" id="FNanchor_4_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_459" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> su
hijo de Ud.?<a name="FNanchor_5_460" id="FNanchor_5_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_460" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>&mdash;Solo veintiún años; pero ha viajado mucho<a name="FNanchor_6_461" id="FNanchor_6_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_461" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> y tiene una experiencia
que Ud. no esperaría encontrar en un joven de esa edad.</p>

<p>&mdash;Le felicito. La edad que tiene su hijo es la mínima a que puede
ejercerse el corretaje en el Uruguay. La ley argentina exige veintidós
años de edad, pero su hijo los tendría mientras cumpliese con la
condición de residencia en caso que el ofrecimiento hubiera sido hecho
desde ese país.</p>

<p>&mdash;Me dicen que en Chile mi hijo no podría ser corredor antes de los
veinticinco años. Yo diría que ese límite es demasiado elevado. ¿No lo
encuentra Ud. excesivo?</p>

<p>&mdash;Sí; mucho.<a name="FNanchor_7_462" id="FNanchor_7_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_462" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>&mdash;Espero que el hecho de ser extranjero no será un impedimento para el
ejercicio del corretaje.</p>

<p>&mdash;¡No faltaría más!<a name="FNanchor_8_463" id="FNanchor_8_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_463" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> No, señor, de ningún modo. Pero si Ud. me lo
permitiese, le recomendaría hiciera matricular a su hijo en el Tribunal
de Comercio.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Convendría que mi hijo aprendiese el castellano antes de partir?</p>

<p>&mdash;Ciertamente. Sería muy problemático su éxito si no lo hablase
correctamente a su llegada.<a name="page_061" id="page_061"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;¿Cree Ud. que se le exigirá una fianza?</p>

<p>&mdash;Es muy probable que se la exijan.</p>

<p>&mdash;Gracias. Quedo muy reconocido por sus consejos.</p>

<p>&mdash;No hay de qué darlas.<a name="FNanchor_9_464" id="FNanchor_9_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_464" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Ojalá su hijo de Ud. tenga el éxito que
merece.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>VIII.&mdash;DERECHOS DE ADUANA<a name="FNanchor_1_465" id="FNanchor_1_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_465" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><br /><br />
<small><i>Use of <b>uno y otro</b>, <b>unos y otros</b>; <b>Custom-House</b> Vocabulary</i></small><br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h3>

<p>&mdash;Como Ud. sabe, los gobiernos de los países latino-americanos obtienen
sus rentas, principalmente, de los derechos de importación,<a name="FNanchor_2_466" id="FNanchor_2_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_466" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> y en
segundo lugar de la contribución directa.<a name="FNanchor_3_467" id="FNanchor_3_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_467" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Los unos son percibidos por
el gobierno federal; la otra<a name="FNanchor_4_468" id="FNanchor_4_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_468" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> por las municipalidades. El gravamen
impuesto a las mercaderías importadas es también un medio de evitar su
concurrencia con las de fabricación nacional, las cuales quedan así
protegidas por el estado.<a name="page_062" id="page_062"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;¿Están sujetos, a derechos todos los artículos importados?</p>

<p>&mdash;Hay algunos cuya importación está exenta de gravamen, y en este número
figuran ciertas materias primeras<a name="FNanchor_5_469" id="FNanchor_5_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_469" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> necesarias en la industria y
otras<a name="FNanchor_6_470" id="FNanchor_6_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_470" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> cosas que contribuyen directamente al progreso del país, como
los libros, por ejemplo. Los unos y las otras<a name="FNanchor_7_471" id="FNanchor_7_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_471" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> entran, como se dice,
libres de derecho.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿A qué principio se obedece al fijar los derechos de aduana?</p>

<p>&mdash;Tomando por base el valor del artículo y teniendo en cuenta en algunos
casos el peso y, en otros,<a name="FNanchor_8_472" id="FNanchor_8_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_472" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> la calidad del mismo. Estos derechos, <i>ad
valorem</i>, como se los llama, varían entre el dos y el ochenta por ciento
del valor de los artículos.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Y cómo se determina el valor de la mercadería importada? Pienso que
podría dar motivo al fraude si para eso bastara la declaración del
comerciante o la presentación de la factura.</p>

<p>&mdash;Tiene Ud. razón. Uno u otro<a name="FNanchor_9_473" id="FNanchor_9_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_473" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> método se prestaría al engaño; y para
evitarlo, existe una tarifa llamada de avalúos, que no es sino<a name="FNanchor_10_474" id="FNanchor_10_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_474" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> la
lista de las mercaderías con los valores que tienen en plaza. Estos
valores se revisan periódicamente y en algunos casos son un poco
diferentes de los corrientes en el mercado.</p>

<p>&mdash;Pero ocúrreseme que en esa lista no puede incluirse los nombres de
todos los artículos de exportación. ¿Cómo se las<a name="FNanchor_11_475" id="FNanchor_11_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_475" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> arreglan los
inspectores cuando tienen que habérselas con<a name="FNanchor_12_476" id="FNanchor_12_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_476" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> un artículo nuevo, o de
una calidad nueva?</p>

<p>&mdash;Ciertamente, ni uno ni otro<a name="FNanchor_13_477" id="FNanchor_13_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_477" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> de los artículos que Ud. supone<a name="page_063" id="page_063"></a>
estarían en la lista. Esas mercaderías pagan un tanto por ciento sobre
su valor, evitándose así toda omisión o contrabando.</p>

<p>&mdash;Si no me equivoco,<a name="FNanchor_14_478" id="FNanchor_14_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_478" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> dijo Ud. que los derechos se cobran también de
acuerdo con el peso: ¿se incluye en éste el del envase?</p>

<p>&mdash;A veces. Pero suele ocurrir que en el peso se computa sólo el del
envase inmediato de la mercadería; es decir, las cajas de cartón o
latón, los frascos, etc., o bien se incluye en el peso hasta el de las
cajas exteriores de madera. En el primer caso se trata de peso neto; en
el segundo, de peso bruto.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿No hay artículos que pagan derecho con arreglo a su peso absoluto,
excluyéndose todo envase?</p>

<p>&mdash;Sí; y entonces se trata de peso neto verdadero.</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Cuántos contratiempos puede traer a los exportadores la ignorancia de
esas prácticas!</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Figúrese Ud.!<a name="FNanchor_15_479" id="FNanchor_15_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_479" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Exportadores hay que<a name="FNanchor_16_480" id="FNanchor_16_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_480" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> ponen catálogos y libros
de propaganda entre mercaderías sujetas a derechos con arreglo al peso
bruto. El peso extraño agregado, aumenta innecesariamente el monto de
los derechos. Otros ignoran que en ciertos países las mercaderías
ligeras, como cintas, blusas, camisas, etc., pagan derechos con arreglo
al peso neto; y en vez de<a name="FNanchor_17_481" id="FNanchor_17_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_481" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> remitirlas envueltas por docenas<a name="FNanchor_18_482" id="FNanchor_18_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_482" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> en
papel liviano, puesto que el envase inmediato habría de computarse en el
peso, las envían acondicionando cada pieza en una caja por separado, con
lo cual acrecientan enormemente los gastos de aduana. Unos y otros<a name="FNanchor_19_483" id="FNanchor_19_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_483" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
se exponen a sufrir interminables desagrados.<a name="page_064" id="page_064"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;¿Dan las aduanas certificados de depósito por las mercaderías que
reciben los comerciantes y que depositan en los almacenes fiscales?</p>

<p>&mdash;Lo hacen en algunos países, en los cuales se descuentan <i>warrants</i>
corrientemente. El <i>warrant</i> es un duplicado del certificado de
depósito, y con él se puede obtener crédito<a name="FNanchor_20_484" id="FNanchor_20_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_484" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> con la garantía<a name="FNanchor_21_485" id="FNanchor_21_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_485" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> del
valor en prenda.</p>

<small><i>Vocabulary relating to <b>Public Hygiene</b></i></small><br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h3>

<p>&mdash;Tengo en perspectiva<a name="FNanchor_1_486" id="FNanchor_1_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_486" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> un viaje por la América latina; pero le
confesaré<a name="FNanchor_2_487" id="FNanchor_2_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_487" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> que me preocupa la duda de si<a name="FNanchor_3_488" id="FNanchor_3_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_488" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> en esos países la salud
del viajero está suficientemente garantizada.</p>

<p>&mdash;He de<a name="FNanchor_4_489" id="FNanchor_4_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_489" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> decir a Ud. que a ese respecto nadie podría dar a Ud. una
contestación que le satisficiese,<a name="FNanchor_5_490" id="FNanchor_5_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_490" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> pues el continente ofrece
diferencias capitales desde el punto de vista de su estado higiénico.
Sepa Ud.,<a name="FNanchor_6_491" id="FNanchor_6_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_491" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> sin embargo, que hallará oficinas de<a name="page_065" id="page_065"></a> sanidad en las
principales ciudades, cuyos inspectores tienen a su cargo la vigilancia
de los domicilios privados, de las casas de comercio y edificios
públicos, para asegurarse de que se cumplen las leyes que protejen la
salud de la población.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Hay en la América latina muchas enfermedades endémicas?</p>

<p>&mdash;Expliquémonos<a name="FNanchor_7_492" id="FNanchor_7_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_492" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>: En la zona tórrida es posible que encuentre Ud.
fiebres palúdicas, el <i>hookworm</i>, y en los barrios desaseados de algunas
comunas, algunos casos de fiebre amarilla y de peste bubónica; pero la
América latina va conquistando poco a poco los enemigos de la salud y de
la vida. En la parte austral del continente encontrará Ud. ciudades en
las cuales la mortalidad es notablemente reducida.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Está reglamentada la circulación de las aguas servidas<a name="FNanchor_8_493" id="FNanchor_8_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_493" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>?</p>

<p>&mdash;En las principales ciudades. En algunas, el sistema de cloacas,
alcantarillado y desagüe se halla en excelentes condiciones. Muchos
pantanos, charcas y esteros se han cegado, y rigen leyes estrictas para
el riego.</p>

<p>La provisión de aguas es objeto de atención preferente, y hay ciudades
que gastan muchos millones en la extensión constante de este servicio,
de acuerdo con el aumento de la población.</p>

<p>La inspección de mataderos y mercados es escrupulosa en los países más
adelantados, lo mismo que la inspección del pescado, la leche, aves,
encurtidos, frutas y legumbres. Se inspeccionan igualmente las
salchicherías, las cabrerías, tambos o vaquerías y las cuadras de burras
de leche. También se inspeccionan los establos, caballerizas y corrales
para hacer efectiva su limpieza y garantizar la salud de las reses.<a name="page_066" id="page_066"></a></p>

<p>Son muy interesantes las leyes de policía sanitaria<a name="FNanchor_9_494" id="FNanchor_9_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_494" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> con respecto al
tráfico interprovincial, a la importación y exportación de animales
vivos, para evitar el tránsito de animales enfermos.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Qué grado de adelanto han alcanzado los estudios médicos?</p>

<p>&mdash;Eso depende del país de que se trate, y es muy señalado en los más
adelantados. En la Universidad de Buenos Aires los estudiantes de
medicina superan en número a los de cualquier otra profesión, incluso la
de leyes. En esa ciudad los hospitales y clínicas destinados a la
práctica de la enseñanza están a veces mejor dotados que los de Europa.</p>

<p>Como consecuencia de<a name="FNanchor_10_495" id="FNanchor_10_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_495" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> la generalización de los estudios médicos, los
servicios públicos relacionados con la higiene se han perfeccionado y
extendido; de lo cual resulta que<a name="FNanchor_11_496" id="FNanchor_11_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_496" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> algunos de esos países tienen
leyes perfectas que reglamentan<a name="FNanchor_12_497" id="FNanchor_12_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_497" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> la práctica de la medicina y el
ejercicio de la farmacia.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Qué requisito debe llenar el médico extranjero que desee ejercer su
profesión en la América latina?</p>

<p>&mdash;La legislación no es uniforme; pero por lo general se somete el
candidato a un examen de reválida, de acuerdo con el plan de
estudios<a name="FNanchor_13_498" id="FNanchor_13_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_498" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> de la universidad donde se presenta. Tal privilegio se le
concede sólo si<a name="FNanchor_14_499" id="FNanchor_14_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_499" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> los certificados que exhibe se consideran
aceptables.<a name="page_067" id="page_067"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;¿No hay tratados de reciprocidad con respecto a los títulos
profesionales entre esos países y los Estados Unidos?</p>

<p>&mdash;No; pero algunas de esas repúblicas han celebrado tratados entre sí o
con España y Francia. De acuerdo con esos convenios, se omite el examen
previo del candidato y sólo se le exige la presentación del título o
diploma, que es visado por la Facultad de Medicina y refrendado por el
Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores<a name="FNanchor_15_500" id="FNanchor_15_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_500" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> en los países que los han
celebrado.</p>

<p>&mdash;No puedo menos de manifestar<a name="FNanchor_16_501" id="FNanchor_16_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_501" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> mi complacencia por todo lo que he

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>X.&mdash;VAPORES<br /><br />
<small><i>Vocabulary relating to <b>Shipping</b></i></small><br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h3>

<p>&mdash;Aunque los armadores latino-americanos se han dedicado preferentemente
a comprar en Europa vapores de segunda mano, es indudable que pueden ser
buenos clientes de los astilleros norteamericanos, especialmente en la
adquisición de embarcaciones propias para<a name="FNanchor_1_503" id="FNanchor_1_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_503" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> el comercio de cabotaje.</p>

<p>&mdash;Yo creía que el comercio de cabotaje entre los países de la América
latina se hacía por medio de buques extranjeros.</p>

<p>&mdash;Esos<a name="FNanchor_2_504" id="FNanchor_2_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_504" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> se ocupan del tráfico costanero internacional; aunque<a name="page_068" id="page_068"></a> me
parece que los armadores de la América latina acabarán por dominar ese
tráfico también.</p>

<p>&mdash;Sorpréndeme en extremo lo que Ud. me dice. Según eso<a name="FNanchor_3_505" id="FNanchor_3_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_505" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> ¿hay compañías
navieras latino-americanas?</p>

<p>&mdash;Ciertamente, desde Méjico a la Tierra del Fuego. Para no citar sino
las más importantes,<a name="FNanchor_4_506" id="FNanchor_4_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_506" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> diré a Ud. que una de ellas, la Argentina, tiene
un capital de diez millones de pesos oro, la que está dando altos
dividendos. Tiene cerca de cien embarcaciones, algunas de más de tres
mil toneladas de registro, muchas de doble hélice y unas cuantas de tres
hélices.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Qué clase de buques son esos?</p>

<p>&mdash;Barcos de vapor, es decir, vapores de río para pasajeros y
vapores-correos que hacen el servicio fluvial en el interior de la
Argentina y Paraguay y, además, entre los puertos marítimos de las
costas australes argentinas, aun llegando hasta el Brasil.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿No hacen esas compañías servicio internacional de pasajeros?</p>

<p>&mdash;La compañía argentina lo hace entre ese país, el Uruguay y el Brasil.
De las dos compañías brasileñas que conozco, una ha iniciado el tráfico
ultramarino con paquetes transatlánticos que llegan hasta Nueva York con
pasajeros y carga. Una compañía chilena y otra peruana tienen vapores
cómodos que transportan pasajeros y tocan en los puertos del Pacífico,
entre Valparaiso y Panamá. La compañía peruana posee vapores de turbina
que hacen alrededor de veinte nudos por hora. La flota latinoamericana
cuenta además con paquebotes fluviales americanos o ferribotes, vapores
de carga y buques mercantes<a name="page_069" id="page_069"></a> de menor desplazamiento. Incluye muchas
barcas y lanchas de pesca, remolcadores, balandras, chatas, lanchones,
aparte de innumerables botes, lanchas de recreo, lanchas salvavidas,
lanchetas, etc. El equipo de estas compañías comprende muchas obras
importantes, como diques de carena, diques secos, almacenes, guinches
hidráulicos, dragas, etc.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿El personal de esas flotas es latino-americano?</p>

<p>&mdash;Casi todo el personal de mando lo es; y así, verá Ud. muchos criollos
entre los capitanes y patrones de los buques, así como entre los
oficiales de a bordo. Sin embargo entre éstos abundan los italianos, y
sobre todo entre los pilotos, prácticos, contramaestres, y la
tripulación de los buques. Los oficios de pescador, de barquero y de
botero atraen muchos genoveses. Los gondoleros casi siempre son
venecianos.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>XI.&mdash;LA CAZA Y SUS PRODUCTOS<br /><br />
<small><i>Uses of the <b>Preterite Indicative</b> and <b>Imperfect</b></i></small><br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h3>

<p>&mdash;El interés que mis hermanos<a name="FNanchor_1_507" id="FNanchor_1_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_507" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> y yo demostramos por la caza nos viene
quizá por herencia,<a name="FNanchor_2_508" id="FNanchor_2_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_508" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> pues nuestro padre pasó una gran parte de su vida
en Sud América, cazando animales salvajes que desolló más de una vez con
sus propias manos.<a name="FNanchor_3_509" id="FNanchor_3_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_509" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Nos decía que las selvas allí son muy espesas y
que la lucha entre las especies animales hace su caza difícil.<a name="page_070" id="page_070"></a></p>

<p>Nuestro padre vendió muchas pieles de puma y de jaguar y levantó con su
comercio una pequeña fortuna, pero no se hallaba a gusto<a name="FNanchor_4_510" id="FNanchor_4_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_510" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> fuera de su
país. Llovía siempre, los caminos eran malos y nunca pudo encontrar
servidores fieles. Debido a estas y otras dificultades que siempre
encontraba, decidió abandonar la comarca. Así es que un año en que<a name="FNanchor_5_511" id="FNanchor_5_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_511" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
los negocios empeoraron, vendió la finca que tenía, se trasladó al oeste
de Sud América y recorrió Bolivia y el Perú donde hizo muchos negocios
en lanas de alpaca y de vicuña. Por fin venía para Estados Unidos cuando
yo nací.</p>

<p>Ahora nosotros nos hallamos<a name="FNanchor_6_512" id="FNanchor_6_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_512" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> dispuestos a invertir dinero en una forma
más completa, estableciendo una fuerte casa en Sud América que se ocupe
de la compra de pieles, así como también de su elaboración, en las
condiciones más perfectas que sea dable alcanzar. ¿Qué le parece a Ud.
nuestra idea?</p>

<p>&mdash;Excelente. Uds. harán fortuna con el comercio de la piel de
chinchilla, de la cibelina, del armiño y de la marta, animales de cuyas
pieles se obtiene mayor rendimiento.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿En qué países se hace ese comercio?</p>

<p>&mdash;La caza de los animales nombrados es más activa en el Perú, Bolivia,
Chile y Argentina, así como también en el Brasil. Pero además de los
animales nombrados, esos países proporcionarían otros, que viven en sus
bosques, llanuras y ríos así como en sus costas oceánicas. Entre estos
últimos está el lobo de mar de las costas australes, conocido en el
comercio con el nombre de «lobo de dos pelos» y que en los mercados
europeos obtiene precios que oscilan entre cuatro y seis libras
esterlinas<a name="page_071" id="page_071"></a> cada uno. Las pieles de nutria quintuplican su valor después
de elaboradas. El zorro sudamericano, sobre todo el zorrito gris,
multiplica por diez su valor originario cuando se le convierte en
estolas y manguitos. Y a propósito de esta prenda de abrigo, sepa Ud.
que los de mayor tamaño pasan por ser de garduña, siendo así que se
fabrican con la piel de la zarigüeya o comadreja americana, que se
compra a diez centavos en los países de que tratamos. La humilde mofeta,
llamada en unas partes <i>zorrino</i>, y en otras <i>mapurite</i>, sale de Sud
America en estado bruto y regresa valiendo en pesos lo que por ella se
pagó en centavos. Y todavía quedan sin mencionar el murciélago, el mono
y otros muchos animales cuyas pieles dejarían pingües utilidades si se
las preparase en el lugar mismo de producción<a name="FNanchor_7_513" id="FNanchor_7_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_513" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> y obedeciendo a métodos
modernos.</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Pues qué!<a name="FNanchor_8_514" id="FNanchor_8_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_514" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> ¿No se elaboran las pieles de los animales que se cazan?</p>

<p>&mdash;No, señor. En esos países, por regla general, solamente la materia
prima es objeto de comercio; es decir, que el negocio de peletería se
reduce casi únicamente a<a name="FNanchor_9_515" id="FNanchor_9_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_515" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> la exportación de las pieles. Esto con
referencia a<a name="FNanchor_10_516" id="FNanchor_10_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_516" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> las pieles finas; que<a name="FNanchor_11_517" id="FNanchor_11_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_517" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> a las otras se les saca el
pelo, con el cual se fabrican fieltros sacrificando así un producto que
debidamente elaborado podría dejar utilidades mucho mayores.<a name="page_072" id="page_072"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;¿Ni siquiera esas últimas se trabajan en el país después de
peladas<a name="FNanchor_12_518" id="FNanchor_12_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_518" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>?</p>

<p>&mdash;Casi nada. Se curten y se exportan. Pues bien,<a name="FNanchor_13_519" id="FNanchor_13_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_519" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> a pesar de que con
esa negligencia los comerciantes se perjudican a sí mismos,<a name="FNanchor_14_520" id="FNanchor_14_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_520" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> las
utilidades que recogen son considerables.</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Quién había de decirlo!<a name="FNanchor_15_521" id="FNanchor_15_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_521" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>&mdash;Debo también advertir a Uds. que las pieles finas así manipuladas no
siempre obtienen buenos precios en los mercados europeos, porque a veces
llegan a ellos en mal estado.</p>

<p>&mdash;Los datos que Ud. me da confirman mi opinión de que un establecimiento
bien montado, con sucursales o agentes en las repúblicas que Ud. ha
nombrado, daría proficuas utilidades a los iniciadores.</p>

<p>&mdash;Yo también lo creo. El establecimiento en que Ud. piensa<a name="FNanchor_16_522" id="FNanchor_16_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_522" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> se
ocuparía también de la venta de pluma. No sé si Ud. sabrá<a name="FNanchor_17_523" id="FNanchor_17_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_523" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> que
algunos estancieros han hecho fortunas criando avestruces en
semi-domesticidad, y que otros han introducido el de África, cuya pluma
es más apreciada, sobre todo para fabricar esas boas de pluma que usan
las señoras.</p>

<p>&mdash;Hablando de plumas, no puede olvidarse la de garza. ¡Qué<a name="FNanchor_18_524" id="FNanchor_18_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_524" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> crecidas
ganancias no dejará<a name="FNanchor_19_525" id="FNanchor_19_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_525" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> ese negocio si se le practica con tino y
economía!<a name="page_073" id="page_073"></a></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>XII.&mdash;ZONAS DE VEGETACIÓN<br /><br />
<small><i>Physiographical Terms</i></small><br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h3>

<p>&mdash;Unos me hablan de la pobreza del suelo de la América latina y otros<a name="FNanchor_1_529" id="FNanchor_1_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_529" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
me ponderan sus producciones, la profusión de su vegetación, lo
magnífico y exuberante de sus selvas. Comprendo que en ese continente
debe de<a name="FNanchor_2_530" id="FNanchor_2_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_530" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> haber numerosas zonas de vegetación,<a name="FNanchor_3_531" id="FNanchor_3_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_531" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> mas confieso que no
tengo ideas precisas<a name="FNanchor_4_532" id="FNanchor_4_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_532" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> acerca de la situación de tales zonas.</p>

<p><a name="page_074" id="page_074"></a>&mdash;Pues mire Ud. este mapa, y comience la observación por su propio
país. ¿No reconoce Ud. aquí la gran meseta del estado de Colorado como
una ancha faja que penetra en Méjico?</p>

<p>&mdash;Sí, la reconozco, y veo que en Méjico la meseta corre paralelamente a
la dirección general del país, dejando un borde de cada lado, entre ella
y los océanos.</p>

<p>&mdash;Muy bien. Y observe Ud. que la meseta termina por el sur<a name="FNanchor_5_533" id="FNanchor_5_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_533" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> muy cerca
de la costa austral.</p>

<p>&mdash;Advierto también que al sur de la meseta<a name="FNanchor_6_534" id="FNanchor_6_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_534" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> se extiende un gran valle,
entre aquélla y la Sierra Madre del Sur, próximo a la costa.</p>

<p>&mdash;Pues bien: el conocimiento de esta topografía del suelo de Méjico,
unido al del régimen de los vientos, nos da la clave para comprender las
regiones climatéricas<a name="FNanchor_7_535" id="FNanchor_7_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_535" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> de ese país.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Cómo así?<a name="FNanchor_8_536" id="FNanchor_8_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_536" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>&mdash;Los vientos alisios, que vienen del nordeste, al pasar por el Golfo de
Méjico, se cargan de humedad, la cual depositan en forma de lluvia en
las faldas de las montañas que directamente se les oponen, es decir, el
borde oriental de la meseta y la vertiente norte de la Sierra Madre del
Sur.</p>

<p>&mdash;Por lo tanto,<a name="FNanchor_9_537" id="FNanchor_9_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_537" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> la falda opuesta de la meseta, es decir el borde que
mira hacia el Pacífico, no recibiendo esos vientos, debe de ser más
árida.<a name="page_075" id="page_075"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;Pero haré notar que en cambio esa falda está favorecida por los
vientos contraalisios que soplan en dirección contraria.<a name="FNanchor_10_538" id="FNanchor_10_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_538" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>&mdash;Así, pues,<a name="FNanchor_11_539" id="FNanchor_11_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_539" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> irrigada una vertiente de la meseta por los vientos
alisios, y la otra, por los contraalisios, la zona intermedia se hallará
privada de su beneficio.</p>

<p>&mdash;Precisamente es eso lo que sucede: las lluvias son escasas en la
meseta central. Una cosa parecida ocurre en ciertas regiones llanas como
Yucatán, con la diferencia que ese territorio se halla situado
precisamente en el camino que recorren los vientos cargados de humedad.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Cómo no recibe lluvias, entonces?</p>

<p>&mdash;Porque no hay en esa comarca montañas en cuyas faldas pudieran
condensarse los vapores. Esta circunstancia geográfica condena a Yucatán
a perpetua sequía. En las regiones que se hallan sometidas a esta
condición se encuentran los cactus, los agaves y otras plantas fibrosas
características de las regiones muy secas.</p>

<p>&mdash;Según eso, las faldas de la meseta mejicana deben de ser muy fértiles.</p>

<p>&mdash;En efecto allí se encuentran espesos bosques, de árboles tan
gigantescos como el <i>ahuehuete</i>, que alcanza una altura de cuarenta
metros, y otros árboles cuya madera se usa en ebanistería como la caoba,
el ébano y el palo rosa. Allí crecen también el árbol de la goma, caucho
o hule, la vainilla, el cacao, árboles frutales y, además, plantas
semi-tropicales como el tabaco, el cafeto, la caña de azúcar, el
algodonero y muchos otros.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Qué clase de vegetación crece en la altiplanicie?</p>

<p>&mdash;Sobre todo prados de gramíneas, especialmente maíz,<a name="page_076" id="page_076"></a> aunque éste se
cultiva en todo el país. En la parte norte de la altiplanicie se dilatan
espléndidas tierras de pastoreo.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Cuál es la relación entre el clima, la topografía y las producciones
de la América Central?</p>

<p>&mdash;En esa parte del continente la cordillera de los Andes modifica la
dirección de los vientos e introduce diferencias en la cantidad de
lluvias que reciben las regiones situadas al este y al oeste de aquélla.
Además, la elevación del suelo determina numerosos niveles de cultivo.</p>

<p>&mdash;La cordillera, pues, favorece a unos y perjudica a otros.</p>

<p>&mdash;Ud. lo ha dicho. En Centro América la mitad occidental recibe el
beneficio de los contraalisios, está profusamente regada por ríos, y por
lo tanto es más fértil y más rica que la mitad oriental. En esta última
los alimentos principales deben ser importados, con excepción de la
banana. El otro factor es el nivel del suelo. Las zonas bajas son
cálidas y allí hay plantaciones<a name="FNanchor_12_540" id="FNanchor_12_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_540" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> de los productos típicos del
trópico, como el cacao, el caucho, el banano o plátano, el cocotero y
los árboles de maderas finas. El café se cultiva en zonas más altas y
por lo tanto más templadas. Más arriba todavía se producen el maíz, las
patatas, las habas, porotos o fríjoles.</p>

<p>&mdash;En este mapa se ve cómo la cordillera se ensancha al penetrar en Sud
América.</p>

<p>&mdash;Y observe Ud. que la meseta así formada<a name="FNanchor_13_541" id="FNanchor_13_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_541" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> adquiere su anchura máxima
en Bolivia.<a name="page_077" id="page_077"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;¿Es también estéril esa meseta?</p>

<p>&mdash;Mucho, y por las razones ya examinadas. Tenga Ud. en cuenta que en Sud
América los alisios soplan del nordeste y del sudeste, convergiendo
sobre el valle del Amazonas, al que llevan enormes cantidades de lluvia
de que benefician no sólo el Brasil sino los países limítrofes, las
Guayanas, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador y Perú e indirectamente (por los
ríos que en esas zonas nacen) el Paraguay y las repúblicas del Plata.
Pero esos vientos depositan en ese valle toda la humedad que traen, de
modo que están ya secos cuando llegan a la altiplanicie del oeste.</p>

<p>&mdash;Ahora me explico<a name="FNanchor_14_542" id="FNanchor_14_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_542" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> el contraste entre la aridez de la parte
occidental del Perú y la fertilidad de las faldas orientales, o sea lo
que allí se llama la Montaña.</p>

<p>&mdash;Y sobre todo se explicará Ud. la aridez del desierto de Atacama, al
norte de Chile.</p>

<p>&mdash;Sin embargo, entiendo que Chile, algo más al sur, es país muy fértil.</p>

<p>&mdash;Tan así es<a name="FNanchor_15_543" id="FNanchor_15_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_543" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> que, en su parte austral, Chile cuenta con más de
veinte millones de hectáreas de bosques. La razón de esta fertilidad
reside en que, al sur del paralelo de los cuarenta grados de latitud
sur, soplan constantemente vientos del oeste, que proporcionan humedad a
las faldas occidentales de los Andes.</p>

<p>&mdash;Dada la gran cantidad de agua que cae en el Brasil, es de suponer<a name="FNanchor_16_544" id="FNanchor_16_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_544" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
que en ese país se encuentran las grandes selvas<a name="FNanchor_17_545" id="FNanchor_17_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_545" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> del continente.<a name="page_078" id="page_078"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;En efecto en esa zona, que además del Brasil incluye parte del Ecuador
y Perú, así como las llanuras del norte que comprenden las Guayanas,
Venezuela y Colombia, se hallan las mayores extensiones de bosque virgen
que quedan aún sin explotar<a name="FNanchor_18_546" id="FNanchor_18_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_546" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> en el planeta. En un radio de ochenta
metros en esa zona, se han contado cuarenta variedades de árboles, tanto
de los que dan maderas de construcción y ebanistería, como de los que
producen materias tintóreas, resinas o sustancias medicinales. Esa
región es muy rica en caucho, vainilla, cinchona, nuez del Brasil y
cocoteros.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Todo el territorio del Brasil se halla en esa región de bosques?</p>

<p>&mdash;Con excepción de una vasta meseta que ocupa la parte oriental de ese
país. La meseta determina aquí también una diferencia de clima,
haciéndolo más templado. Al igual que en la meseta de Méjico y en los
altos valles, altozanos, sierras bajas y collados que se alzan al pie de
la cordillera en la América Central, Colombia, Ecuador y Perú, aquí se
ven hermosas tierras de pastoreo, adecuadas para la cría del ganado,
producción de granos y frutas propias de las zonas templadas. Las frutas
admíranse sobre todo en la parte norte de la meseta, donde prospera,
además, el tabaco, la caña de azúcar y el algodón. Sorprenden allí al
viajero los enormes ingenios<a name="FNanchor_19_547" id="FNanchor_19_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_547" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> para la elaboración del azúcar,
provistos de la maquinaria más moderna. En esa zona también se han
establecido recientemente fábricas para el tejido<a name="FNanchor_20_548" id="FNanchor_20_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_548" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> del algodón. Todos
estos establecimientos utilizan como energía la de los saltos de agua.<a name="page_079" id="page_079"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;¿Y qué me dice del café<a name="FNanchor_21_549" id="FNanchor_21_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_549" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>?</p>

<p>&mdash;Las haciendas cafeteras más prósperas se han instalado en el borde
oriental de la altiplanicie.</p>

<p>&mdash;Veo señalados en el mapa otros bosques,<a name="FNanchor_22_550" id="FNanchor_22_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_550" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> circundando la meseta
brasileña.</p>

<p>&mdash;Son los bosques del oriente de Bolivia, los del Paraguay y del norte
de la Argentina. Pero en esa región la selva no es continua, sino que
alterna con llanos pantanosos cubiertos de pastos espesos. Más hacia el
sur de la meseta, los bosques son más ralos, sobre todo al este del río
Paraná, y donde se hallan separados entre sí por llanuras cubiertas de
vegetación herbácea. En la república del Uruguay los árboles
desaparecen, a la par que el suelo adquiere cierta semejanza con el de
las pampas.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Qué extensión tienen las pampas?</p>

<p>&mdash;Ocupan un sector de circulo de unas quinientas millas de radio cuyo
centro es Buenos Aires. En su rico suelo se cultivan los cereales con
los cuales se alimentan millones de personas en Europa. En esa zona se
aplican los métodos agrícolas más adelantados. La propaganda agrícola es
allí casi tan intensa como en los Estados Unidos, y se realiza mediante
escuelas de agricultura, estaciones experimentales y conferencias
públicas dadas a los agricultores por peritos que, al efecto, viajan en
trenes especiales.</p>

<p>Es esta la región de las colonias<a name="FNanchor_23_551" id="FNanchor_23_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_551" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> de inmigrantes, de la
estancia<a name="page_080" id="page_080"></a><a name="FNanchor_24_552" id="FNanchor_24_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_552" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> moderna con sus vastas construcciones, su maquinaria
agrícola de último modelo, sus plantíos científicamente cultivados, sus
rebaños<a name="FNanchor_25_553" id="FNanchor_25_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_553" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> transformados mediante operaciones zootécnicas largas y
costosas.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Cómo es el suelo al sur de las pampas?</p>

<p>&mdash;En el extremo sur se extiende una meseta desprovista de árboles
excepto en la parte más austral, donde aquéllos reaparecen, gracias a la
humedad que, como le expliqué ya, traen los vientos del Pacífico. Esta
meseta es muy apropiada para la cría de ovejas.</p>

<p>&mdash;La región del Plata debe de ser muy rica en el metal que lleva ese
nombre.</p>

<p>&mdash;Pues ésa es precisamente<a name="FNanchor_1_554" id="FNanchor_1_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_554" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> la parte de la América latina donde menos
abunda. El nombre de Argentina debería en justicia<a name="page_081" id="page_081"></a><a name="FNanchor_2_555" id="FNanchor_2_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_555" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> corresponder a
los países que en un tiempo fueron famosos por su riqueza en plata, a
saber:<a name="FNanchor_3_556" id="FNanchor_3_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_556" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Bolivia con sus otrora<a name="FNanchor_4_557" id="FNanchor_4_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_557" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> famosas minas de Potosí, el Perú y,
en menor grado,<a name="FNanchor_5_558" id="FNanchor_5_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_558" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Méjico y Chile.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿De dónde procede, pues, ese nombre?</p>

<p>&mdash;Fué dado por un poeta, José del Barco Centenera, en un poema que
compuso en el siglo XVII, describiendo las bellezas del territorio que
hoy ocupa la república austral. El título traduce en forma poética el
nombre que los exploradores dieron a su gran río, creyendo que en su
proximidad había plata. De paso diré a Ud. que a la ausencia de metales
preciosos deben las comarcas<a name="FNanchor_6_559" id="FNanchor_6_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_559" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> del río de la Plata su prosperidad
actual.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Es posible?</p>

<p>&mdash;Libradas a sí mismas, debieron desarrollar otro género de riqueza, y
la encontraron en el cultivo del suelo. La vida agrícola desarrolló el
espíritu de independencia y la facultad de ayuda propia<a name="FNanchor_7_560" id="FNanchor_7_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_560" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> que tanto les
sirviera<a name="FNanchor_8_561" id="FNanchor_8_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_561" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> en la época de la reconstrucción.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Qué otros países producen plata?</p>

<p>&mdash;Méjico en primera línea<a name="FNanchor_9_562" id="FNanchor_9_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_562" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> y luego el Perú, que cuenta con<a name="page_082" id="page_082"></a> las ricas
minas del Cerro de Pasco. Bolivia conserva su antigua fama, aunque hoy
día casi toda la plata que produce procede de la compañía Huanchaca.
Chile trabaja igualmente sus minas argentíferas.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Tiene minas de plata la América Central?</p>

<p>&mdash;Sí, y están en poder de norteamericanos e ingleses. La plata en
barras<a name="FNanchor_10_563" id="FNanchor_10_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_563" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> de Costa Rica es muy apreciada.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Se explotan aún las minas de oro que los españoles trabajaban en la
época de la conquista?</p>

<p>&mdash;Algunas continúan entregando su generoso tributo, y de ellas no pocas
están en Méjico que encabeza la lista de los países latino-americanos
productores de oro. Otras hay en Centro América, de donde todavía hoy se
exportan cantidades considerables de oro en tejos.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Es allí donde se encuentra la famosa mina de Aguacate?</p>

<p>&mdash;Sí; en Costa Rica. Por su parte, Honduras tiene otra mina celebrada,
la Rosario,<a name="FNanchor_11_564" id="FNanchor_11_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_564" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> que produjo más de diez y seis millones de duros en
treinta años.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Es esa la mina más rica del mundo?<a name="FNanchor_12_565" id="FNanchor_12_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_565" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>&mdash;No; la que en realidad merece ese nombre está en Venezuela y dió
veinticinco millones de duros en veinte años.</p>

<p>&mdash;También se dice que la América es el continente del cobre.<a name="FNanchor_13_566" id="FNanchor_13_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_566" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>&mdash;En verdad sus minerales están muy diseminados en el hemisferio
occidental, sobre todo al oeste de la cordillera.<a name="page_083" id="page_083"></a> Hubo un tiempo<a name="FNanchor_14_567" id="FNanchor_14_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_567" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> en
que Chile contribuyó con las tres cuartas partes<a name="FNanchor_15_568" id="FNanchor_15_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_568" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> de la producción
mundial de cobre. Eso ocurría antes que los Estados Unidos y Méjico
entraran en el mercado.</p>

<p>&mdash;Ahora Chile ha visto alzarse otro competidor, el Perú, donde ha
penetrado el capital norteamericano.</p>

<p>&mdash;Y algún día ambos países sufrirán la concurrencia de otro competidor
formidable, el Ecuador, donde hay ricos yacimientos de cobre que no se
explotan por falta de<a name="FNanchor_16_569" id="FNanchor_16_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_569" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> capitales y medios de comunicación.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Y el hierro?</p>

<p>&mdash;Existe en el Brasil, Chile, Venezuela, Colombia, América Central y las
Antillas. Parece que el estado brasileño de Minas Geraes contiene más
hierro que toda Europa. De los<a name="FNanchor_17_570" id="FNanchor_17_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_570" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> filones estudiados, muchos se
consideran explotables por el sistema de excavaciones abiertas,
calculándose que existen ochenta millones de metros cúbicos.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Cuál es el rendimiento?</p>

<p>&mdash;Se obtienen cuatro toneladas por metro cúbico.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Es cierto que Chile fué el primer país hispano-americano que comenzó
a explotar el hierro?</p>

<p>&mdash;Sí; y en gran escala. Pero ahora se le exporta más que<a name="FNanchor_18_571" id="FNanchor_18_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_571" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> se le
trabaja, lo que, en opinión de algunos,<a name="FNanchor_19_572" id="FNanchor_19_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_572" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> conviene menos a los
intereses del país.<a name="page_084" id="page_084"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;¿Es de buena calidad el mineral de hierro de Chile?</p>

<p>&mdash;Uno de los más ricos que se conocen. Da setenta por ciento de
rendimiento y contiene muy poco fósforo.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Es de Chile el famoso mineral de hierro de Tambo Grande?</p>

<p>&mdash;Del Perú. El hierro de ese distrito es el más conocido de la república
mencionada, aunque hasta ahora<a name="FNanchor_20_573" id="FNanchor_20_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_573" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> se ha hecho muy poco para explotar
sus abundantes yacimientos. En Colombia ha comenzado la explotación
seria. Las fundiciones de Pradera son muy importantes y pueden producir
cincuenta toneladas al día, incluyendo el hierro en lingotes y la
manufactura de hierro forjado o batido, rieles y hierro colado.</p>

<p>&mdash;Debe de haber carbón en la vecindad de esa fundición.</p>

<p>&mdash;No sólo carbón, sino cal, arena, manganeso y arcilla refractaria. Por
lo cual<a name="FNanchor_21_574" id="FNanchor_21_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_574" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> la localidad es muy ventajosa para la industria.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Cómo se obtienen las concesiones de minas en la América latina?</p>

<p>&mdash;Por procedimientos diferentes. En algunos países es menester<a name="FNanchor_22_575" id="FNanchor_22_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_575" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
poseer el terreno en propiedad<a name="FNanchor_23_576" id="FNanchor_23_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_576" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>; en otros las denuncias se hacen
sobre una zona de mil hectáreas, o sea unos 2500 acres, pagándose cierto
impuesto por hectárea. Algunos gobiernos conceden libre entrada por sus
aduanas a la maquinaria para las minas.<a name="page_085" id="page_085"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;¿Está Ud. con los que opinan que la América latina es pobre en carbón?</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Cómo había de estar<a name="FNanchor_3_579" id="FNanchor_3_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_579" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>? El carbón no abundará<a name="FNanchor_4_580" id="FNanchor_4_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_580" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> en ella como en
Europa, Estados Unidos y otras partes; pero es innegable que en esa
parte del mundo hay importantes yacimientos carboníferos que aguardan su
explotación.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Está el carbón muy diseminado?</p>

<p>&mdash;Al contrario; se le halla solamente en ciertos distritos, como en los
estados de Sonora, Coahuila y Veracruz en Méjico, parte del Brasil en el
Atlántico y algunas regiones del Perú y Chile en el Pacífico. Estas
últimas vetas tal vez se extienden a la Argentina. También se han
descubierto extensos depósitos de carbón en Colombia. Venezuela explota
varias minas; América Central y las Antillas están perfeccionando el
procedimiento de las concesiones en las suyas.</p>

<p>&mdash;Me dicen que<a name="FNanchor_5_581" id="FNanchor_5_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_581" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Chile explota minas submarinas de carbón.</p>

<p>&mdash;Sí; y ocupan cerca de cien millas en los distritos de Lota y Coronel.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Hállase muy diseminado el petróleo?<a name="page_086" id="page_086"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;Desde Méjico hasta Magallanes. Se sabe que un vastísimo depósito se
extiende desde el Orinoco hasta la Argentina. De este depósito beneficia
Bolivia en la región de Calacoto. Pero Méjico es el productor de
petróleo, por excelencia. Solamente en Tampico hay más de cien pozos
petrolíferos cuya producción anual es de muchos millones de barriles.
Más de cien compañías se han organizado, la mitad de las cuales
funcionan con capitales norteamericanos.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Sabe Ud. cuánto dinero hay invertido en esa industria?</p>

<p>&mdash;Vamos a ver<a name="FNanchor_6_582" id="FNanchor_6_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_582" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>; déjeme pensar.<a name="FNanchor_7_583" id="FNanchor_7_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_583" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Se han invertido ya alrededor de
doscientos millones de dólares, según opinión que<a name="FNanchor_8_584" id="FNanchor_8_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_584" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> merece plena fé.</p>

<p>&mdash;Y en el resto de la América latina, ¿qué oportunidades ofrece la
explotación del petróleo?</p>

<p>&mdash;Buenas, porque ese producto está poco explotado todavía. Sin embargo,
en Venezuela hay más de cincuenta pozos; en el Ecuador trabajan varias
compañías inglesas; y en el Perú, en que predomina el capital inglés,
las perforaciones aumentan cada día.</p>

<p>&mdash;Recientemente se ha hablado del petróleo argentino en los círculos
financieros de Nueva York.</p>

<p>&mdash;Últimamente<a name="FNanchor_9_585" id="FNanchor_9_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_585" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> se descubrió por acaso ese producto en el territorio
argentino del Chubut mientras se hacían perforaciones en busca de agua.
Se calcula que algunos pozos dan cerca de ochocientos metros cúbicos por
día.<a name="FNanchor_10_586" id="FNanchor_10_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_586" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> El producto es algo pesado, y la proporción de petróleo liviano
es pequeña;<a name="page_087" id="page_087"></a> pero tal como sale, constituye un buen combustible que ya
se usa en la industria.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Quedan todavía<a name="FNanchor_11_587" id="FNanchor_11_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_587" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> zonas de petróleo inexplotadas en la América
latina?</p>

<p>&mdash;Muchísimas, y gran parte de ellas están en la América Central y
Antillas. En Cuba la producción no guarda proporción con la extensión de
los depósitos. Y eso que el petróleo de Cuba es excepcionalmente puro y
de calidad superior: he ahí<a name="FNanchor_12_588" id="FNanchor_12_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_588" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> otra oportunidad industrial.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Hay gas natural en la América latina?</p>

<p>&mdash;Se le encuentra asociado al petróleo. Se sabe que existe en el Brasil,
cerca del río Negro. En la Argentina, antes de llegar a la napa de
petróleo se descubrió una zona que produce enormes cantidades de gas.</p>

<p>&mdash;Me dicen que hace poco tiempo se descubrió en Méjico una nueva
variedad de caucho.</p>

<p>&mdash;Suele encontrarse nuevas especies de cuando en cuando.<a name="FNanchor_2_590" id="FNanchor_2_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_590" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>&mdash;¿Son muchas las ya conocidas<a name="FNanchor_3_591" id="FNanchor_3_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_591" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>?</p>

<p>&mdash;Centenares; pero no todas son igualmente provechosas,<a name="page_088" id="page_088"></a> hablando
comercialmente. Los árboles más buscados<a name="FNanchor_4_592" id="FNanchor_4_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_592" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> son los que pueden ser
sangrados muchas veces, dando en cada sangría la misma cantidad de
látex. Los árboles que se agotan sangrándolos pocas veces,<a name="FNanchor_5_593" id="FNanchor_5_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_593" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> no tienen
valor comercial.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Forma el árbol del caucho selvas naturales?</p>

<p>&mdash;El árbol de la goma o hule, como se le llama en la América española,
crece, juntamente con otras especies vegetales, en las selvas tropicales
que cubren las llanuras fértiles, los valles bajos y laderas de las
regiones cálidas. Pero la goma recogida en esos cauchales o hulares
naturales no tiene tanta fama en los mercados como la procedente de
árboles que se han cultivado en plantaciones artificiales. Los nativos
de las zonas del caucho emplean métodos destructivos. Extraen el jugo
hiriendo el tronco del árbol con sus machetes, sin tener en cuenta el
número de veces que la planta ha sido sangrada previamente, ni la
estación del año en que lo hacen. Gran parte de la goma recogida en
Méjico, la América Central, Colombia, Perú y Ecuador tiene este origen,
aunque el cultivo científico del caucho se generaliza en esos países. En
los cargamentos de goma que Perú exporta desde Iquitos por vía<a name="FNanchor_6_594" id="FNanchor_6_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_594" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> del
Amazonas, se ven<a name="FNanchor_7_595" id="FNanchor_7_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_595" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> hoy algunos ejemplares de muy buena calidad, aunque
mezclados todavía con muchas &lsquo;cabezas de negros.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Cabezas de negros!</p>

<p>&mdash;Así se llaman en el Brasil, en jerga comercial,<a name="FNanchor_8_596" id="FNanchor_8_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_596" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> las masas de caucho
que proceden de los látex sucios.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Son ésos los &lsquo;Ceará scraps&rsquo;?<a name="page_089" id="page_089"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;No; los &lsquo;Ceará scraps&rsquo; son trozos de caucho desecados en los árboles y
que los nativos recogen y venden a bajo precio. Y a propósito de nombres
extraños, hay que mencionar la <i>achuca</i> y el <i>chamote</i>, como se llaman
dos plantas que en América Central y Perú respectivamente sirven para
coagular el látex.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Están ya exploradas todas las regiones que producen caucho?</p>

<p>&mdash;La zona del caucho es demasiado extensa<a name="FNanchor_9_597" id="FNanchor_9_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_597" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> para ser<a name="FNanchor_10_598" id="FNanchor_10_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_598" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> bien conocida.
Comprende desde el norte de Méjico hasta el sur del Brasil, con la
excepción de las laderas occidentales de los Andes. En esta inmensa
extensión, la región explotada es unicamente la contigua a los ríos.
Todo lo demás es suelo virgen.</p>

<p>&mdash;Siempre he oído mencionar el caucho de Pará como el más puro.</p>

<p>&mdash;El Brasil produce la mitad de la cosecha mundial de caucho, y Pará es
uno de sus grandes centros productores. Los «discos y frascos»<a name="FNanchor_11_599" id="FNanchor_11_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_599" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> de
Pará se han afamado en el mercado de la goma.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Qué otras suertes<a name="FNanchor_12_600" id="FNanchor_12_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_600" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> comerciales se conocen?</p>

<p>&mdash;El caucho de Cartagena que se exporta en panes grandes de cincuenta
kilogramos; el de las Antillas (que comprende el de la América Central)
que se exporta igualmente en panes; el de Guayaquil, que es de tipo poco
uniforme y cuyo color varía entre el blanquecino de las clases
superiores, y el oscuro pardo de las más impuras. El caucho boliviano
que se extrae de los territorios nacionales de ese país se cotiza a
buenos precios.<a name="page_090" id="page_090"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;El caucho es una de las substancias más maravillosas del siglo XX.</p>

<p>&mdash;No debemos olvidar que la extensión de su uso en la vida ordinaria se
debe al descubrimiento casual de que en combinación con el azufre, la
goma se convierte en una substancia dura que puede reemplazar con
ventaja y económicamente a la madera, los metales y el <i>papier maché</i>.</p>

<p>&mdash;Ud. se refiere a la goma vulcanizada. Pero recuerdo que la goma,
mezclada a su vez con cierta clase de papel forma la «fibra», substancia
que está destinada a un uso ilimitado como sucedánea del cuero. Y a
propósito, ¿el chicle de mascar se obtiene de los mismos árboles de
donde se extrae el caucho?</p>

<p>&mdash;No, de ninguna manera. El chicle se saca del zapote y del chicozapote,
árboles de Méjico y América Central.</p>

<p>&mdash;Se dice que el negocio del chicle está expuesto a fraudes debido a la
introducción de piedras que, a escondidas,<a name="FNanchor_13_601" id="FNanchor_13_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_601" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> agregan los productores a
sus remesas.</p>

<p>&mdash;Esas prácticas cesaron desde que los manufactureros introdujeron en
sus contratos cláusulas que determinan el grado de pureza que habrá de
tener el producto.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Son altos los derechos de importación del chicle?</p>

<p>&mdash;Alrededor de diez centavos por libra. Para disminuir este recargo, se
le suele introducir por el Canadá, donde el chicle se refina. Como en
este estado su peso se reduce a la mitad, la economía es considerable.</p>

<p>&mdash;Si la diminución de peso debida al refinado alcanza, como Ud. dice, al
50%, habría conveniencia en establecer refinerías de chicle en Méjico a
fin de economizar los gastos de flete.</p>

<p>&mdash;Ciertamente. Se ahorraría así lo que hoy se paga por transportar tres
mil toneladas anuales de desperdicio.</p>

<small><i>Vocabulary relating to <b>Agriculture</b></i></small><br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h3>

<p>&mdash;¿Se cultiva el trigo en toda la América latina?</p>

<p>&mdash;No en toda, porque ese cereal requiere un clima fresco, habiéndose
comprobado que toda elevación brusca de temperatura, a no ir
acompañada<a name="FNanchor_1_602" id="FNanchor_1_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_602" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> de humedad, acelera la terminación de la vida de la
planta, que sólo da entonces cosechas incompletas.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Cuál es la región del trigo en la América latina?</p>

<p>&mdash;Las zonas templadas y frías de Sud América, especialmente las pampas
argentinas en una extensión de cien millones de hectáreas. El suelo es
fértil, el clima templado, la precipitación de lluvia suficiente y
oportuna para el crecimiento gradual de los cultivos; los cambios de
tiempo no son raros, pero su intensidad es limitada; los ríos, arroyos y
lagos no escasean; y, además, el agricultor está seguro de encontrar,
siempre una napa subterránea de agua apropiada para el regadío.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Es muy grande la extensión en Argentina ya cultivada con trigo?</p>

<p>&mdash;Tanto como la de ambas Dakotas, Minnesota e Illinois juntos.<a name="FNanchor_2_603" id="FNanchor_2_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_603" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>&mdash;¿Qué rendimiento da el trigo en la Argentina?</p>

<p>&mdash;De trece hectolitros por hectárea arriba,<a name="FNanchor_3_604" id="FNanchor_3_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_604" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> según los métodos de
cultivo.<a name="page_092" id="page_092"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;¿Se usa el <i>bushel</i> norte americano en la medida del trigo?</p>

<p>&mdash;No; la unidad de volumen usada en las transacciones es el hectolitro;
el peso de un hectolitro de trigo puede decirse que determina su
calidad; y así, un trigo que pesa ochenta kilogramos por hectolitro
puede considerarse<a name="FNanchor_4_605" id="FNanchor_4_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_605" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> excelente.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Cuántas labores reciben los campos?</p>

<p>&mdash;Generalmente una sola en mayo, junio o julio, seguida de operaciones
complementarias con la rastra y el rodillo cuando el trigo ha sido
sembrado.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Úsase todavía en el Río de la Plata el arado de madera, tirado por
bueyes?</p>

<p>&mdash;Hace un cuarto de siglo ese instrumento de labranza fué substituido
por el arado de acero, tirado por caballos, a fin de obtener un trabajo
más rápido. Hoy día ese medio no basta, y la magnitud de las operaciones
agrícolas ha hecho necesario el uso de arados de tracción mecánica, con
más de veinte rejas, que llevan a cabo un trabajo que hace poco habría
parecido un sueño poder realizar.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Se siembra a mano?</p>

<p>&mdash;Las razones ya dadas hacen indispensable el empleo de máquinas
sembradoras, con las cuales se abrevia la operación.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Por qué<a name="FNanchor_5_606" id="FNanchor_5_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_606" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> tiempo se cosecha?</p>

<p>&mdash;Hacia diciembre o enero, empleándose máquinas segadoras-agavilladoras,
así llamadas porque siegan las mieses y atan las gavillas las que,
recogidas luego en grandes carros, se amontonan en parvas. También se
usan esas maravillosas máquinas modernas que cortan las espigas, trillan
el trigo y lo embolsan.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Qué sistema se sigue para trillar el trigo?</p>

<p>&mdash;No necesitaré decirle que en la región a que me refiero la<a name="page_093" id="page_093"></a> trilla no
se hace ya por medio de caballos que pisan las mieses después de
segadas.<a name="FNanchor_6_607" id="FNanchor_6_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_607" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>&mdash;Me han dicho, sin embargo, que ese procedimiento subsiste todavía en
Sud América.</p>

<p>&mdash;Tal vez en regiones donde se cultivan reducidas cantidades de grano
para el consumo local. En la Argentina se usa la máquina trilladora.
Estas máquinas van de hacienda en hacienda,<a name="FNanchor_7_608" id="FNanchor_7_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_608" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> alquilando sus servicios.
A veces los agricultores de un distrito, no pudiendo tener cada uno su
propia<a name="FNanchor_8_609" id="FNanchor_8_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_609" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> trilladora, se asocian entre sí,<a name="FNanchor_9_610" id="FNanchor_9_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_610" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> formando sociedades
agrícolas cooperativas para comprar una máquina en común.<a name="FNanchor_10_611" id="FNanchor_10_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_611" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>&mdash;¿Se conoce en esas comarcas lo que aquí se llaman <i>options</i>?</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Qué es éso?<a name="FNanchor_11_612" id="FNanchor_11_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_612" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>&mdash;En Estados Unidos se juega el curso del trigo, operando sobre
mercancías a librar<a name="FNanchor_12_613" id="FNanchor_12_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_613" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> y al descubierto<a name="FNanchor_13_614" id="FNanchor_13_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_614" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>; es decir, sin que en
realidad se transfiera mercadería alguna, sino que se está sólo a<a name="FNanchor_14_615" id="FNanchor_14_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_615" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
las diferencias entre los precios que existan el día fijo y aquéllos a
que se compró y vendió.</p>

<p>&mdash;No se hacen esas especulaciones en la Argentina y le diré por qué: El
agricultor no retiene su trigo para venderlo cuando mejor le parezca,
como se hace en Estados Unidos. En el Río de la Plata el agricultor
suele vender su trigo antes de cosechado.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿A quién lo vende?<a name="page_094" id="page_094"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;A los agentes de las grandes casas exportadoras, las cuales guardan el
trigo en depósito y lo venden de acuerdo con la demanda del mercado
universal.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿No procuran los agricultores imponer sus precios de acuerdo con las
condiciones de las plazas importadoras?</p>

<p>&mdash;Eso han comenzado a hacer las sociedades cooperativas, construyendo
silos donde el trigo pueda guardarse en depósito, elevadores de granos
para uniformar los tipos del cereal, bancos agrícolas que hagan
préstamos al agricultor con un interés moderado, complementando todo
esto con el aseguro de sus cosechas contra el granizo, la langosta y
otros muchos contratiempos.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Se exporta la mayor parte de la cosecha del trigo?</p>

<p>&mdash;Sí; y ésa es la razón, dicho sea de paso,<a name="FNanchor_15_616" id="FNanchor_15_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_616" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> por qué los trigales se
encuentran próximos a los puertos de embarque o en las zonas servidas
por los ferrocarriles que comunican fácilmente con esos puertos.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>XVII.&mdash;MAÍZ<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h3>

<p>&mdash;¿Se cultiva el maíz en las mismas regiones que el trigo?</p>

<p>&mdash;El maíz es poco exigente<a name="FNanchor_1_617" id="FNanchor_1_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_617" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> en cuanto a clima y localidad. Se le
cultiva en laderas, hondonadas, mesetas, valles, umbrías y tierras
llanas y abiertas.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Prospera, pues, el maíz en toda la América latina?</p>

<p>&mdash;En América, el maizal es cosa muy común desde el Canadá<a name="page_095" id="page_095"></a> a la Tierra
del Fuego. La América contribuye con tres cuartas partes a la producción
mundial de maíz.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿No cree Ud. que en el futuro, más o menos lejano,<a name="FNanchor_2_618" id="FNanchor_2_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_618" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> el cultivo del
maíz se vea amenazado por una crisis de superproducción?</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Oh, no hay probabilidad<a name="FNanchor_3_619" id="FNanchor_3_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_619" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> de que éso suceda! Tenga Ud. en cuenta que
los Estados Unidos están disminuyendo gradualmente los cultivos de este
cereal. Como por otra parte el consumo del maíz debe necesariamente ir
en aumento,<a name="FNanchor_4_620" id="FNanchor_4_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_620" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> se sigue<a name="FNanchor_5_621" id="FNanchor_5_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_621" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> que siempre habrá demanda por ese grano.</p>

<p>&mdash;Parece, sin embargo, que los métodos de cultivo no son del todo
perfectos<a name="FNanchor_6_622" id="FNanchor_6_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_622" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> en la América latina. En algunos países se dice que se le
cultiva<a name="FNanchor_7_623" id="FNanchor_7_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_623" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> sólo para usarlo como maloja, o sea como forraje; es decir,
que únicamente se utilizan las hojas y el tallo.</p>

<p>Es verdad que en una gran zona del continente la cosecha es deficiente
en cantidad y pobre en calidad, razón por la cual hay que importar gran
parte del maíz que consume la población; pero esto mismo es un aliciente
para iniciar en los países menos adelantados el cultivo perfeccionado de
ese cereal.</p>

<p>&mdash;Tal vez ciertas tierras no se prestan para el cultivo de las especies
comestibles.</p>

<p>&mdash;Se engaña Ud. Los experimentos<a name="FNanchor_8_624" id="FNanchor_8_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_624" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> han demostrado que en<a name="page_096" id="page_096"></a> el
mismísimo<a name="FNanchor_9_625" id="FNanchor_9_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_625" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> suelo, donde tan deficiente es por ahora la cosecha, pueden
obtenerse resultados excepcionalmente satisfactorios.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Qué rendimiento da el maíz en la América latina?</p>

<p>&mdash;De tres a siete mil kilogramos por hectárea; pero si el agricultor
emplease métodos más perfeccionados, es indudable que con un aumento
insignificante en los gastos doblaría la suma de sus productos.</p>

<p>&mdash;Indudablemente el maíz es un producto nutritivo de inmenso valor.</p>

<p>&mdash;Tiene Ud. razón. Esa planta proporciona al natural de América un
alimento barato, sano y fácil de preparar.</p>

<p>&mdash;En la América sajona las rosetas de maíz que Uds. llaman <i>pop-corn</i>
podrían ser el emblema de las multitudes alegres y bulliciosas. Y esa
modesta golosina no es menos popular en las otras Américas con los
nombres de <i>palomitas</i>, <i>esquites en miel</i>, <i>alborotos</i>, <i>pororó</i> y
otros muchos.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Las gachas hechas con maíz fragmentado son tan caras al<a name="FNanchor_10_626" id="FNanchor_10_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_626" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> pueblo
hispano-americano como el <i>hominy</i> lo es al nativo de la Nueva
Inglaterra o de Virginia?</p>

<p>&mdash;Tanto o más<a name="FNanchor_11_627" id="FNanchor_11_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_627" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>; y el modesto plato de <i>mazamorra</i> ha tenido también
sus Whittiers,<a name="FNanchor_12_628" id="FNanchor_12_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_628" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> que han cantado, como él,<a name="FNanchor_13_629" id="FNanchor_13_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_629" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> aunque en otra lengua,
los méritos del clásico tazón familiar.</p>

<p>&mdash;La fama de las tortillas de Méjico y el resto de la América tropical
ha llegado a este país. ¿De qué modo se preparan?<a name="page_097" id="page_097"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;La tortilla es el Proteo de los manjares<a name="FNanchor_14_630" id="FNanchor_14_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_630" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> a que el maíz da origen.
Es <i>enchilada</i> cuando se la adereza con <i>chile</i> o ají pimiento; admite
rellenos variadísimos, y la simple adición del queso le da centenares de
nombres.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Qué es el <i>tamal</i>?</p>

<p>&mdash;Un manjar hecho con maíz tierno rallado, pimientos, tomates, grasa y
azúcar que se cuece en agua o en el baño maría,<a name="FNanchor_15_631" id="FNanchor_15_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_631" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> calentándolo al
rescoldo.<a name="FNanchor_16_632" id="FNanchor_16_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_632" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Este plato, más o menos modificado, se consume en toda la
América española y se llama <i>humita</i> en Chile y el Río de la Plata y
<i>chigüil</i> en otras partes. Antes de cocer se la envuelve por lo general
en <i>chala</i> seca, como se llama la espata que rodea la mazorca del maíz.
Hácense, además, sabrosos guisos con el maíz, al que acompañan numerosos
complementos que le sirven de aderezo, desde el <i>charqui</i> o carne seca
con que se prepara el <i>locro</i> en el sur del continente, hasta el pescado
y la carne de cerdo con que se hace en Méjico el <i>chilatole</i>.</p>

<p>No hablemos de<a name="FNanchor_17_633" id="FNanchor_17_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_633" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> golosinas hechas con maíz, pues son infinitas. El
<i>chipá</i> de los paraguayos es, en realidad, una especie de pan; pero las
roscas y rosquetas de maíz son bollos muy agradables en cuya preparación
entra la manteca, huevos, leche y azúcar. Con leche de coco y melaza, la
harina tostada del maíz constituye un dulce exquisito que llaman
<i>tequiche</i> y <i>chancaca</i>. En la región del Mar Caribe, gusta mucho la
<i>hayaca</i>, torta de maíz con que se reemplaza la clásica torta de
Navidad, y que se condimenta con pasas, almendras, aceitunas, y otras
muchas cosas sabrosas.<a name="page_098" id="page_098"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;¿Dígame, que es la <i>chicha</i>?</p>

<p>&mdash;Es la famosa bebida que los primitivos incas preparaban fermentando el
maíz. Todavía se la consume en las poblaciones rurales de Bolivia, Perú,
Argentina y Chile, aunque en este último se aplica el nombre más bien a
un riquísimo vino, muy poco fermentado, de uva blanca del país. Pero hay
otras bebidas suaves y agradables a base de<a name="FNanchor_18_634" id="FNanchor_18_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_634" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> harina tostada y
aromatizadas de distintas maneras, tales como el <i>guarrús</i> de Colombia,
el <i>tiste</i> de la América Central y el <i>ulpo</i> de Chile. Para la fiesta de
Corpus, los habitantes de Quito beben el <i>champús</i>, hecho con gachas de
harina de maíz, mezcladas con jugo de naranjilla.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>XVIII.&mdash;CACAO<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h3>

<p>&mdash;«Cacao rojo,» «Cacao blanco»: ¿qué significan esos nombres?</p>

<p>&mdash;Son designaciones comerciales del cacao. Esas bolsas que Ud. ve ahí<a name="FNanchor_1_635" id="FNanchor_1_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_635" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
son de «Cacao guayana» y de «Cacao del río.»</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Qué nombre más extraño<a name="FNanchor_2_636" id="FNanchor_2_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_636" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> este último!</p>

<p>&mdash;Es el que se da al cacao de las Antillas.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Cuál es el mejor cacao?</p>

<p>&mdash;Su pregunta no es de fácil contestación.<a name="FNanchor_3_637" id="FNanchor_3_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_637" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Los cacaos que pasan por
ser<a name="FNanchor_4_638" id="FNanchor_4_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_638" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> de mejor calidad son los que se cultivan en Venezuela,<a name="page_099" id="page_099"></a> en Méjico
(particularmente el de Soconusco), en Colombia (sobre todo el del Cauca)
y en el Ecuador, Guatemala y Costa Rica. Pero como Ud. sabe, va mucho en
gustos.<a name="FNanchor_5_639" id="FNanchor_5_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_639" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Yo, de mí, sé decir<a name="FNanchor_6_640" id="FNanchor_6_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_640" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> que prefiero el cacao de Bolivia,
especialmente el que se cultiva en las faldas de La Paz y Cochabamba;
otros se quedan con el del Espíritu Santo o Bahía, en el Brasil. También
mucho depende de los cambios que la iniciativa de los plantadores
introduce en el veredicto comercial; y no sería extraño que el
Perú&mdash;donde recientemente se han hecho inmensas plantaciones sobre una
base científica&mdash;viera los mercados del mundo disputándose<a name="FNanchor_7_641" id="FNanchor_7_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_641" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> su cacao.</p>

<p>&mdash;Y dada la situación de los mercados consumidores y el clima y el suelo
de los países productores, ¿dónde cree Ud. que el cultivo del cacao
ofrecería mayores alicientes?</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Hum! La cosa no es fácil de resolver a dos tirones.<a name="FNanchor_8_642" id="FNanchor_8_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_642" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Pero, dejando
de lado toda consideración basada en las condiciones actuales del
mercado, me inclinaría a creer que el cacao de Santo Domingo puede tener
una ventaja sobre los otros.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Qué le hace<a name="FNanchor_9_643" id="FNanchor_9_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_643" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> a Ud. suponer éso?</p>

<p>&mdash;El hecho de que Santo Domingo queda más cerca de Nueva York que
cualquiera de los demás países productores.<a name="page_100" id="page_100"></a> Por lo demás,<a name="FNanchor_10_644" id="FNanchor_10_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_644" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> la
cosecha que ahora se recoge y exporta desde Santo Domingo aumenta de año
en año,<a name="FNanchor_11_645" id="FNanchor_11_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_645" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> y ha dado ya a ese país un puesto importante entre los
productores de cacao.</p>

<p>&mdash;Buen negocio sería, pues, explotar ese cultivo en la isla dominicana;
pero a estar a lo que Ud. dice,<a name="FNanchor_12_646" id="FNanchor_12_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_646" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> será a la fecha<a name="FNanchor_13_647" id="FNanchor_13_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_647" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> imposible
encontrar ya buenas tierras por poco dinero; ¿No es así?</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Oh, no! Todavía quedan terrenos fértiles, húmedos y densos, muchos de
ellos con la proporción de arena que conviene al cacao; tierras que se
venden a bajo precio y que podrían colonizarse con provecho.</p>

<p>&mdash;Por mi parte temo que los caminos de Santo Domingo no sean muy buenos.</p>

<p>&mdash;Advertiré a Ud. que el cacao es de fácil conducción y que para su
transporte no es absolutamente indispensable contar con buenas
carreteras. Después que la cosecha se recoje y se seca, cuesta poco
trabajo conducirla a lomo de mula por los senderos menos transitables en
apariencia.<a name="FNanchor_14_648" id="FNanchor_14_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_648" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>&mdash;¿Y qué beneficio deja el negocio ése?<a name="FNanchor_15_649" id="FNanchor_15_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_649" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>&mdash;Considerable; pues debe Ud. tener en cuenta que transcurridos los
cuatro o cinco primeros años,<a name="FNanchor_16_650" id="FNanchor_16_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_650" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> las utilidades que da el cacao
aumentan progresivamente. Si al principio se hacen los esfuerzos
requeridos y se consagra atención a la empresa, prestando ayuda<a name="FNanchor_17_651" id="FNanchor_17_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_651" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> al
suelo y al clima, haciendo crecer<a name="page_101" id="page_101"></a> los árboles a la distancia que
recomienda la experiencia, podando las plantas para evitar el
desperdicio de la savia, y haciendo, en fin, otras cosas que por ahora
se descuidan, no creo exagerado esperar un interés de treinta y tres por
ciento a los pocos años de establecida la plantación.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>XIX.&mdash;AZÚCAR<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h3>

<p>&mdash;Pues, como íbamos diciendo,<a name="FNanchor_1_652" id="FNanchor_1_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_652" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> cuando la caña está madura se corta con
machetes a poca distancia del suelo, y después de pelada se lleva al
molino o trapiche, cuyos cilindros estrujan las cañas haciéndolas soltar
el jugo que contienen. La caña aplastada y exprimida se llama gabazo, y
se usa como combustible. Al jugo extraído se da el nombre de guarapo.
Este guarapo o zumo contiene substancias que producirían su fermentación
si quedaran en él,<a name="FNanchor_2_653" id="FNanchor_2_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_653" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> y por esta razón se las elimina por medio de una
operación que se llama defecación, y tiene lugar en<a name="FNanchor_3_654" id="FNanchor_3_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_654" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> calderas grandes
de cobre.</p>

<p>&mdash;Me dicen que en Cuba se obtiene el azúcar evaporando el líquido en
calderas abiertas.</p>

<p>&mdash;Esas son cosas de antes,<a name="FNanchor_4_655" id="FNanchor_4_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_655" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> y no creo que ahora haya un solo ingenio
que siga ese procedimiento anticuado. En el día<a name="FNanchor_5_656" id="FNanchor_5_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_656" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> los ingenios están
bien montados con la maquinaria más moderna<a name="FNanchor_6_657" id="FNanchor_6_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_657" class="fnanchor">[6]</a><a name="page_102" id="page_102"></a> y la evaporación se
lleva a cabo<a name="FNanchor_7_658" id="FNanchor_7_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_658" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> en recipientes cerrados llamados tachos al vacío, en los
cuales se concentra el guarapo, después de pasar por los clarificadores
y de haberlo filtrado en filtros-prensas de múltiples capas filtrantes
de carbón animal.<a name="FNanchor_8_659" id="FNanchor_8_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_659" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>&mdash;Tal es el procedimiento que se sigue en los ingenios de la
Luisiana.<a name="FNanchor_9_660" id="FNanchor_9_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_660" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> ¿Y qué se hace con el jarabe concentrado?</p>

<p>&mdash;Se le pasa a las turbinas, o recipientes que giran con gran velocidad
y cuyas paredes obran a manera de cedazo, reteniendo el azúcar
cristalizada, y dejando pasar la melaza despedida por la fuerza
centrífuga.</p>

<p>&mdash;Entre los productores importantes de azúcar de caña, sólo se oye
hablar de Cuba, Méjico, Perú, Santo Domingo, Brasil, Guayanas,
Venezuela, Ecuador y Argentina. ¿No se da la caña en los demás países de
la América?</p>

<p>&mdash;La caña prospera en todos los países de este continente, aun cuando
algunos de ellos, como el Paraguay y otros, la cultivan principalmente
para extraer de ella el alcohol, que se llama también aguardiente de
caña, ron, <i>chinguirito</i> o simplemente caña. Debo advertir, sin embargo,
que casi todos los ingenios tienen destilerías anexas para la
fabricación de alcohol mediante la fermentación de las mieles. Esta
industria secundaria perjudica a veces la principal, como ocurre en
Venezuela donde la industria azucarera decae, debido al monopolio que el
Estado mantiene sobre el ron. En otros países, en cambio,<a name="page_103" id="page_103"></a> como los de
Centro América, no tendrían por qué<a name="FNanchor_10_661" id="FNanchor_10_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_661" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> ocupar un lugar secundario en la
lista y no llegar<a name="FNanchor_11_662" id="FNanchor_11_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_662" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> con el tiempo<a name="FNanchor_12_663" id="FNanchor_12_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_663" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> a ser productores tan
importantes como Cuba misma.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Cree Ud. según eso, que el suelo de la América Central es apropiado
al cultivo de la caña?</p>

<p>&mdash;Sí; pues hay allí una tierra porosa y fácil de labrar. En ciertas
partes de Honduras donde el suelo retiene la humedad, la caña prospera
admirablemente.</p>

<p>&mdash;Me hace Ud. recordar que en Panamá hay muy buenos ingenios y que el
gobierno de esa república estimula la industria.</p>

<p>&mdash;En cuanto a producir,<a name="FNanchor_13_664" id="FNanchor_13_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_664" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> todas las repúblicas centroamericanas lo
hacen. Nicaragua exporta ya azúcar por valor de varios millones de
dólares, lo mismo que San Salvador y Guatemala. Pero la capacidad
productiva de la América Central es enorme, y mucho hay que esperar de
ella todavía.</p>

<p>&mdash;Quizás falta el combustible.<a name="FNanchor_14_665" id="FNanchor_14_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_665" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>&mdash;¡Oh no! Toda la fuerza motriz que se necesitase se obtendría poniendo
diques a las corrientes de agua.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Son muy abundantes?</p>

<p>&mdash;Las hay de sobra<a name="FNanchor_15_666" id="FNanchor_15_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_666" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> en las montañas.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Qué nombres llevan en castellano las variedades comerciales de
azúcar?</p>

<p>&mdash;Tenemos el azúcar blanco o de flor; el azúcar de lustre (que ha sido
molido y pasado por un cedazo); el azúcar moreno,<a name="page_104" id="page_104"></a> negro o prieto, que
está mezclado con melaza; el azúcar piedra en cristales grandes; el
azúcar refinado; y el azúcar terciado, de color intermedio entre el
azúcar moreno y el blanco.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Qué es el azúcar rubio?</p>

<p>&mdash;Comprende todas las variedades de azúcares pardos. Se le llama también
mascabado y no es otra cosa que<a name="FNanchor_16_667" id="FNanchor_16_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_667" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> azúcar no sometido a la filtración
por el carbón animal. En estos azúcares se distinguen las variedades de
«primer chorro,» de «segundo chorro» y de tercero, según el orden en que
se les obtiene de las turbinas. Los azúcares pardos se consumen en toda
la América española con los nombres de chancaca, mazacote, empanizado,
rapadura y panela.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>XX.&mdash;CAFÉ<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h3>

<p>&mdash;¿Cómo se hacen los negocios de café en los países productores?</p>

<p>&mdash;Comerciantes al por mayor compran el café a los plantadores,
adelantando a éstos dinero sobre la cosecha próxima. Entregado el café,
es seleccionado y almacenado. A estos comerciantes se dirigen los
comisionistas para pedirles muestras del grano. Los comisionistas hacen
ofertas luego a los exportadores, quienes, teniendo en cuenta los
pedidos que han recibido, compran y envían la mercadería a su destino.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Y si el café entregado resultase<a name="FNanchor_1_668" id="FNanchor_1_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_668" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> de calidad inferior?<a name="page_105" id="page_105"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;Se apela a Cámaras Arbitrales, las cuales fallan, solicitando
previamente el veredicto de peritos.</p>

<p>&mdash;He oído decir que en el Brasil la tierra cafetera se cultiva hasta
que, hallándose agotada, no produce más, y que entonces se abandona la
plantación para esquilmar de la misma manera las tierras inmediatas.</p>

<p>&mdash;Eso pudo hacerse mientras la tierra era<a name="FNanchor_2_669" id="FNanchor_2_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_669" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> barata; y debo decir a Ud.
que esos métodos convirtieron el suelo en una estepa, pues los
plantadores no se cuidaban de reponer los árboles que habían abatido.
Pero hoy día el precio elevado de los campos requiere que las mismas
tierras se cultiven indefinidamente.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Se abona el suelo?</p>

<p>&mdash;Sí; hoy en día hay plantaciones en el Brasil que pueden servir de
modelo, provistas, como se hallan,<a name="FNanchor_3_670" id="FNanchor_3_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_670" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> de las máquinas e implementos
agrícolas más perfeccionados.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Contribuyó la abolición de la esclavitud a trastornar los negocios en
café?</p>

<p>&mdash;Ese hecho produjo una crisis económica profunda en tales labores; pero
dió al gobierno la oportunidad de poner en práctica un plan de
colonización agrícola para atraer al inmigrante europeo.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Ha visitado Ud. alguna vez una<a name="FNanchor_4_671" id="FNanchor_4_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_671" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> hacienda?</p>

<p>&mdash;Tuve la suerte de<a name="FNanchor_5_672" id="FNanchor_5_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_672" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> visitar un cafetal en el mes de octubre, cuando
los cafetos están en pleno florecimiento.<a name="FNanchor_6_673" id="FNanchor_6_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_673" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Las plantas<a name="page_106" id="page_106"></a> cubrían las
colinas y los llanos, y el aire llevaba a todas partes el delicado
perfume de sus flores. También he visitado el puerto de Santos, por
donde sale la mayor parte de los veinte millones de sacos que el Brasil
exporta.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Llama Ud. saco al costal?</p>

<p>&mdash;Sí; son términos sinónimos. Le llaman también bolsa en algunos países.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Cuántas libras pesa un saco?</p>

<p>&mdash;Cada saco pesa sesenta kilos; es decir unas ciento treinta y dos
libras.</p>

<p>&mdash;Ya se ve, por lo tanto, que el Brasil es el productor más importante
de café.</p>

<p>&mdash;Contribuye con las cuatro quintas partes a la producción mundial. Le
sigue Guatemala, viniendo luego Colombia. Pero en este último país las
dificultades en el transporte limitan la extensión de los cultivos. En
Haití los derechos elevados de exportación tienen el mismo efecto. En el
Perú y en Honduras el negocio sufre por la falta de braceros. En cambio
en el Salvador la prosperidad en el negocio de café es señalada.</p>

<p>&mdash;A propósito de la América Central, ¿sabía Ud. que el café de Costa
Rica se ha cotizado en el mercado de Londres a precios más altos que el
de los demás países de la América Central, lo que no es poco decir?<a name="FNanchor_7_674" id="FNanchor_7_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_674" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>&mdash;¡A quién se lo dice Ud.!<a name="FNanchor_8_675" id="FNanchor_8_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_675" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Yo he sido vendedor de café
centroamericano, y puedo afirmar además que en los últimos años la
producción de café costarricense se ha mantenido firme, a pesar de que
en otros países la superproducción trajo una baja general<a name="page_107" id="page_107"></a> en los
valores. Pero no olvidemos que los cafés de Nicaragua y Panamá están
siendo favorablemente acogidos.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Se conocen muchos tipos comerciales de café americano?</p>

<p>&mdash;Tiene Ud. el que se llama en el comercio<a name="FNanchor_9_676" id="FNanchor_9_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_676" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> café de Santos,
caracterizado por su película rojiza; el de Méjico que se parece al
moka, pero que tiene granos más grandes y su color menos claro<a name="FNanchor_10_677" id="FNanchor_10_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_677" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>; el
café <i>yungas</i> de Bolivia, de semillas grandes; el de Martinica; el de
Cayena, de semillas alargadas e irregulares; los de Puerto Rico y de la
Habana, de color verde azulado. Naturalmente estos colores son los del
grano crudo, que no ha sido tostado. La torrefacción se lleva a cabo en
los centros importadores.</p>

<p>&mdash;Eso será en<a name="FNanchor_1_678" id="FNanchor_1_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_678" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> el distrito de Vuelta Abajo, donde se hallan las vegas
más afamadas. No quiero decir con esto que<a name="FNanchor_2_679" id="FNanchor_2_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_679" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> los plantadores de tabaco
no hacen buenas ganancias en todo el país, a pesar de que los gastos de
cultivo son más elevados que los de la caña.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Está muy explotado el tabaco en Cuba?<a name="page_108" id="page_108"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;Sólo una parte pequeña de la zona apropiada se halla bajo cultivo.</p>

<p>&mdash;Siendo así, me imagino que los otros países de la América latina no
habrán iniciado aún la plantación del tabaco.</p>

<p>&mdash;Sin embargo el Brasil, Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia, Chile, Perú y
Ecuador están obteniendo resultados satisfactorios de esa planta.
Argentina consume su propio tabaco; el Brasil, Paraguay y Chile lo
exportan a sus vecinos y a Alemania. En el Perú se ha establecido el
estanco del tabaco que reglamenta la venta del que se produce en el país
y el que se importa de Méjico, Honduras, Ecuador y Cuba.</p>

<p>&mdash;He oído decir que el intercambio de tabacos entre las repúblicas del
sur disminuye poco a poco.</p>

<p>&mdash;Ese es un buen signo, pues indica que los centros productores mejoran
día a día la industria de elaboración de sus propios tabacos. Además,
esas repúblicas han perfeccionado los métodos de cultivo y ya se aprecia
en ellos la acción de los plantadores inteligentes, quienes hacen una
elección prolija de las semillas y atienden a las condiciones del suelo
y del clima.</p>

<p>&mdash;He oído decir que el tabaco se da muy bien en la América Central.</p>

<p>&mdash;Esa ha sido mi opinión siempre. Los experimentos hechos en Honduras
demuestran que el tabaco sembrado en tierras que han sido cultivadas con
otras plantas da cosechas muy buenas.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿No produce tabaco el resto de las Islas Antillas?</p>

<p>&mdash;Poco; aunque no habría razón para que la producción fuera allí tan
escasa como es. En Haití, por ejemplo, el suelo es muy apropiado para el
cultivo del tabaco, porque en ciertas regiones es arenoso, pedregoso y
poco húmedo. También hay<a name="page_109" id="page_109"></a> allí tierras vírgenes, las cuales, cuando
recién desmontadas,<a name="FNanchor_3_680" id="FNanchor_3_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_680" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> se prestan muy especialmente al cultivo del
tabaco.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Sabe Ud. cómo se clasifica el tabaco, según su empleo en cigarros y
cigarrillos?</p>

<p>&mdash;Los cigarros o puros se fabrican con la hoja de calidad superior. Las
hojas pequeñas, las defectuosas y los recortes se destinan a la
fabricación de tabacos cortados que reciben el nombre de picaduras, y se
destinan a la fabricación de cigarrillos o para quemarlos en pipa. De la
primera clase, los hay de tres tipos: fuerte, entrefuerte y suave.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿De qué depende la fuerza del tabaco?</p>

<p>&mdash;Del modo como se ha curado.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Cuál es el tabaco hebra?</p>

<p>&mdash;El que resulta de cortar la hoja en filamentos. Otra variedad es la de
picadura al grano.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Fabrícanse los puros con hojas enteras?</p>

<p>&mdash;Solamente las cubiertas, que son dos y que se llaman capas. El
interior se denomina tripa, y está hecho con hojas de calidad inferior.
En Cuba, la operación de escogido y separación de hojas para capa y
tripa se llama liga.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>XXII.&mdash;PRODUCCIÓN Y COMERCIO DE PESCADO<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h3>

<p>&mdash;¿Cómo explica Ud. el que se importe el pescado salado y en conserva a
los países latino-americanos en las cantidades<a name="page_110" id="page_110"></a> que indica esta lista?
¿Que no existen<a name="FNanchor_1_681" id="FNanchor_1_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_681" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> peces en sus mares y ríos?</p>

<p>&mdash;Los hay y muy buenos, así de mar, como de agua dulce. Pero los
capitales temen abandonar los caminos trillados.<a name="FNanchor_2_682" id="FNanchor_2_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_682" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> No obstante la
probabilidad<a name="FNanchor_3_683" id="FNanchor_3_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_683" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> de que los negocios de pesquería serían lucrativos en la
América latina, los sistemas de pesca son aún muy primitivos, se carece
de aparejos modernos, y no se cuida de conservar el pescado, como no
sea<a name="FNanchor_4_684" id="FNanchor_4_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_684" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> salándolo y secándolo al sol. El pescado es, por otra parte, un
producto caro, debido precisamente a la deficiencia de los medios que se
emplean para pescarlo y conservarlo. Otro hecho, tal vez consecuencia de
los anteriores, es que el pescado no constituye en la América latina un
artículo de alimentación tan corriente como en los Estados Unidos.</p>

<p>&mdash;Yo no veo en ello sino razones, y muy poderosas,<a name="FNanchor_5_685" id="FNanchor_5_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_685" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> para establecer
pesquerías en esos países, a menos que haya<a name="FNanchor_6_686" id="FNanchor_6_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_686" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> motivo para que el
pescado sea allí menos aceptable que en el resto del mundo.</p>

<p>&mdash;Ningún motivo hay, que yo sepa.<a name="FNanchor_7_687" id="FNanchor_7_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_687" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Por el contrario, en los grandes
centros, como en Río de Janeiro, Montevideo, Buenos Aires, Santiago, la
Habana, Veracruz y otros muchos, existe demanda considerable y sostenida
de pescado. El <i>pejerrey</i>, que es una especie de trucha, gusta mucho en
el Plata y en Chile, lo mismo que el <i>dorado</i> y el <i>surubí</i>; mientras el
<i>huachinango</i><a name="page_111" id="page_111"></a> es plato clásico en las Antillas y los puertos del Golfo
de Méjico. En Chile son muy aceptados, además, el arenque, el escombro y
la merluza del Pacífico, y quizás aun más los peces de agua dulce. El
<i>picarú</i> es tan apreciado en el Perú como el <i>bonito</i> y el pez sol en
Venezuela. Por otra parte, toda iniciativa, por pequeña que sea,
encaminada a fomentar esa industria, es recompensada con crecientes
salidas. Así ha ocurrido con el establecimiento de estaciones pesqueras
en las costas de San Paulo y Santa Catalina en el Brasil, con los
trabajos de propagación de especies comestibles en los ríos de la
Argentina austral y Chile, y con la instalación de flotillas pesqueras
en Maracaibo.</p>

<p>&mdash;No habiendo, pues, prejuicios contra el pescado como alimento, yo creo
que esa industria abre un horizonte nuevo a la iniciativa de los
capitalistas de este país.</p>

<p>&mdash;Me dicen que los gobiernos de la América latina conceden atención
especial al problema de la distribución del agua. Supongo que allí hay
ciertas zonas sujetas a períodos regulares de lluvia y de sequía.</p>

<p>&mdash;Tiene Ud. razón, y hay además lugares donde no llueve jamás, mientras
en otros ocurren inundaciones frecuentes.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Se utiliza el agua subterránea para remediar la falta de agua en la
superficie?</p>

<p>&mdash;En algunas partes se la usa en ciertas industrias, como en la
fabricación de cerveza; en otras se la destina al consumo de<a name="page_112" id="page_112"></a> las
poblaciones. También se la emplea en el regadío; pero a excepción de
algunos lugares en Chile, Argentina, Uruguay y Brasil, las comarcas que
reciben poca lluvia y que por consiguiente carecen de riego natural se
encuentran en sitios montañosos donde no siempre es posible obtener agua
subterránea en condiciones económicas. Por esta causa deben utilizarse
con la mayor ventaja posible los ríos y arroyos de la superficie.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Qué grado de adelanto han alcanzado los sistemas de riego en la
América latina?</p>

<p>&mdash;Un grado bastante elevado y casi todos los gobiernos tratan de
extenderlos y perfeccionarlos. En algunos, el estudio del problema del
regadío está a cargo de comisiones permanentes y en ellos se han
levantado empréstitos de muchos millones de dólares para llevar a cabo
trabajos de largo aliento.<a name="FNanchor_2_689" id="FNanchor_2_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_689" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Obras para regar una extensión de dos
millones de hectáreas han dejado ya de ser<a name="FNanchor_3_690" id="FNanchor_3_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_690" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> una novedad.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Se utilizan en la industria los saltos de agua?</p>

<p>&mdash;Sí, mucho, para la producción de luz, de tracción y de fuerza motriz
industrial, y tengo profunda fe<a name="FNanchor_4_691" id="FNanchor_4_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_691" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> en el progreso de estas empresas en
la América latina; en primer lugar porque no hay región en el mundo
donde sean más copiosas las lluvias ni más numerosos los lagos elevados
y los saltos de agua susceptibles de ser<a name="FNanchor_5_692" id="FNanchor_5_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_692" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> utilizados; en segundo
lugar, por la escasez de combustibles, que llega a veces a<a name="FNanchor_6_693" id="FNanchor_6_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_693" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> hacer
necesario el empleo de la leña para mover las locomotoras, sobre todo en
los sitios alejados<a name="page_113" id="page_113"></a> de los puertos. En tercer lugar, preveo que las
exigencias de la vida civilizada harán cada vez más necesario el
transporte rápido y frecuente de las personas en tranvías y
ferrocarriles eléctricos. En todas las grandes ciudades, el movimiento
de expansión característico de estos tiempos extiende cada vez más los
rieles del tranvía hacia los suburbios, que van convirtiéndose allí
también en lugar preferido de residencia.</p>

<p>&mdash;No olvidemos que la extensión del alumbrado público ha abierto
ilimitadas oportunidades al empleo de la corriente eléctrica. Y me
refiero especialmente a la electricidad, porque el gas debe ser caro en
esos países....</p>

<p>&mdash;Naturalmente; pues es un derivado del carbón. Por eso, muchas ciudades
han pasado de la era del petróleo a la edad de la electricidad. En la
Argentina, más de cien ciudades están alumbradas a luz eléctrica, y la
de Buenos Aires tiene alrededor de diez mil lámparas de arco. En esta
ciudad los dínamos se mueven a vapor, y por lo tanto, la electricidad es
cara; lo que no obsta para<a name="FNanchor_7_694" id="FNanchor_7_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_694" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> que Buenos Aires tenga una de las
instalaciones eléctricas más grandes del mundo.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Hay instalaciones hidroeléctricas de importancia en la América
latina?</p>

<p>&mdash;En el Brasil no es raro ver<a name="FNanchor_8_695" id="FNanchor_8_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_695" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> exclusas de doscientos millones de
metros cúbicos de agua, e instalaciones hidráulicas que envían la
electricidad por más de cien kilómetros de cable.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Se emplea la energía eléctrica solamente como potencia motriz
industrial?</p>

<p>&mdash;También se la aplica a levantar, por medio de bombas, el agua de los
terrenos bajos para regar tierras altas.<a name="page_114" id="page_114"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;En tal caso esas obras producirán un alza en el precio de las tierras
beneficiadas.</p>

<p>&mdash;Ud. lo ha dicho.<a name="FNanchor_9_696" id="FNanchor_9_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_696" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> En ciertos lugares de Chile especialmente
favorecidos por esas obras, el precio de la hectárea subió de cien a mil
quinientos pesos.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Son muchas las empresas norteamericanas que han adquirido concesiones
en las varias repúblicas latino-americanas?</p>

<p>&mdash;No muchas; pero la maquinaria procede en general de los Estados
Unidos.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>XXIV.&mdash;OPORTUNIDADES COMERCIALES EN LA AMÉRICA LATINA<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h3>

<p>&mdash;En verdad,&mdash;dijo el señor Jiménez&mdash;para la actividad comercial
norteamericana no hay campo más apropiado que el continente mismo<a name="FNanchor_1_697" id="FNanchor_1_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_697" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> en
que vivimos.</p>

<p>&mdash;Juntamente con la Rusia y la China&mdash;agregó mister Smith, banquero
<i>yanqui</i>.<a name="FNanchor_2_698" id="FNanchor_2_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_698" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>&mdash;Pero Rusia está demasiado lejos y las condiciones en que ha quedado
después de la guerra no permiten hacer vaticinios fundados,&mdash;replicó el
señor Jiménez.&mdash;En cuanto a la China, tarde o temprano<a name="FNanchor_3_699" id="FNanchor_3_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_699" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> caerá bajo la
dominación japonesa. En<a name="page_115" id="page_115"></a> cambio nuestros mercados latinoamericanos están
menos expuestos a sufrir trastornos.</p>

<p>&mdash;Tal vez tenga Ud. razón,<a name="FNanchor_4_700" id="FNanchor_4_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_700" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> después de todo&mdash;asintió el
banquero;&mdash;pues la verdad es que la América latina nos permite hacer dos
cosas importantes: Primero, concentrar en ella inversiones de dinero
mediante la adquisición de títulos y la colocación de capitales en sus
industrias; y segundo, comerciar con ella.</p>

<p>&mdash;Importando y exportando,&mdash;observó Jiménez.</p>

<p>&mdash;Eso es; importaríamos materias primas de que carecemos<a name="FNanchor_5_701" id="FNanchor_5_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_701" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> y aún
manufacturas que no producimos en la Unión o que conviniera mejor
importar, en vez de fabricarlas aquí. En cuanto a nuestras
exportaciones, claro está que consistirían en el producto variadísimo de
nuestras fábricas.</p>

<p>&mdash;Tocamos aquí un tema interesante,&mdash;dijo a esta altura del diálogo<a name="FNanchor_6_702" id="FNanchor_6_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_702" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
el brasileño, señor Souza.&mdash;Tengo para mí que<a name="FNanchor_7_703" id="FNanchor_7_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_703" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> la doctrina de Monroe
ha de llegar alguna vez a complementarse con una organización comercial,
económica y hasta militar, que permita al continente abastecerse a sí
mismo, dándole al mismo tiempo los medios necesarios para ampliar y
defender sus rutas comerciales.</p>

<p>&mdash;Esa es una magnífica idea,&mdash;dijo mister Smith.&mdash;Pero&mdash;agregó con un sí
es no es de<a name="FNanchor_8_704" id="FNanchor_8_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_704" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> melancolía&mdash;difícil será que mi país desaloje a la Europa
de los mercados de América. Las viejas naciones se han ejercitado por
décadas en un arte que<a name="page_116" id="page_116"></a> apenas comenzamos<a name="FNanchor_9_705" id="FNanchor_9_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_705" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> a ensayar nosotros. Los
plazos comerciales que conceden los comerciantes europeos son mucho más
largos que los nuestros. Aquí no se ve nunca un papel comercial a 180
días, y mucho menos a un año, desde fecha de factura. El pago al contado
o dentro de 30 días impera en este país hasta en el mercado
internacional, al punto de que muchas casas en Filipinas, Cuba y Centro
y Sud América se ven en la necesidad de mantener depósitos en bancos de
este país para atender a sus compras. Es difícil competir, por otra
parte, con naciones que tienen sobre nosotros la ventaja de haber
arraigado ya en esos países, mediante los capitales que han invertido en
multitud de industrias y empresas, las cuales, naturalmente, se proveen
en Europa de los materiales, utensilios y maquinaria que necesitan. Las
relaciones comerciales sólo adquieren incremento entre dos naciones
cuando entrambas mantienen lazos de una interdependencia económica. El
pago de servicios, dividendos y cupones sobre los capitales de un país
invertidos en los otros, estimula una corriente de mercaderías en los
dos sentidos, ya sea como valor de abono o como valor de cobro.</p>

<p>&mdash;Todo eso está muy bueno, mister Smith,&mdash;replicó el señor Souza;&mdash;pero
Ud. no ha dejado de observar, sin duda, que a consecuencia de la guerra,
gran parte de los títulos de esas mismas empresas han cruzado el océano.
Los grandes saldos favorables de la balanza financiera de los Estados
Unidos se están satisfaciendo con papeles de industrias<a name="FNanchor_10_706" id="FNanchor_10_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_706" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> sud y centro
americanas. ¿Quién nos dice que,<a name="FNanchor_11_707" id="FNanchor_11_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_707" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> a consecuencia de esta emigración<a name="page_117" id="page_117"></a>
de valores, la Unión no se ha<a name="FNanchor_12_708" id="FNanchor_12_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_708" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> convertido, a la vuelta de algunos
años,<a name="FNanchor_13_709" id="FNanchor_13_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_709" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> en el acreedor principal de los otros países del continente?</p>

<p>&mdash;Hace Ud. un raciocinio perfectamente lógico&mdash;contestó mister
Smith.&mdash;Si tal cosa ocurriera,<a name="FNanchor_14_710" id="FNanchor_14_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_710" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> es seguro que el intercambio
comercial se produciría casi espontáneamente, como consecuencia
ineludible.</p>

<p>&mdash;Pero hay títulos y títulos,<a name="FNanchor_15_711" id="FNanchor_15_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_711" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>&mdash;observó el señor Jiménez.&mdash;Sería
conveniente que los norteamericanos invirtieran sus capitales en
nuestros ferrocarriles, ante todo<a name="FNanchor_16_712" id="FNanchor_16_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_712" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>; luego en empréstitos nacionales;
en servicios urbanos; en instalaciones hidroeléctricas y en fábricas
para la manufactura de artículos para el mercado de los Estados Unidos.</p>

<p>&mdash;Muestra Ud. su buen juicio al nombrar en primera línea nuestros
ferrocarriles,&mdash;dijo el doctor Mendoza, abogado argentino.&mdash;Entre
nosotros,<a name="FNanchor_17_713" id="FNanchor_17_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_713" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> las concesiones ferrocarrileras están garantizadas en
cierto modo<a name="FNanchor_18_714" id="FNanchor_18_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_714" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> por la nación, pues aquéllas se fundan en contratos
mediante los cuales tanto el gobierno como las compañías definen sus
derechos y obligaciones: el uno, defendiendo los intereses públicos; las
otras en salvaguardia de sus capitales.<a name="page_118" id="page_118"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;Esa provisión es digna de todo elogio,<a name="FNanchor_19_715" id="FNanchor_19_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_715" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>&mdash;dijo mister Smith&mdash;En los
Estados Unidos no procedemos así, pues los ferrocarriles se han acogido
a las oportunidades ofrecidas por los diferentes estados, pero no se han
firmado contratos, y en consecuencia el gobierno no se halla facultado
para indagar la situación financiera de los ferrocarriles, salvo en los
casos en que los tribunales declaran no existir relación equitativa
entre los ingresos procedentes de la explotación de un ferrocarril y el
capital invertido.</p>

<p>&mdash;Por mi parte,<a name="FNanchor_20_716" id="FNanchor_20_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_716" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> preveo un enorme campo de acción para los capitales
que hayan de emplearse en instalaciones hidroeléctricas,&mdash;dijo el señor
Souza.&mdash;En la América latina la substitución del vapor por la
electricidad<a name="FNanchor_21_717" id="FNanchor_21_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_717" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> en la generación de fuerza trae una economía mucho
mayor que en los Estados Unidos.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Por qué razón?&mdash;preguntó uno de los circunstantes.</p>

<p>&mdash;Pues, porque<a name="FNanchor_22_718" id="FNanchor_22_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_718" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> los Estados Unidos consumen su propio carbón,
mientras que en los países de la América latina lo importan, razón por
la cual les resulta más caro.</p>

<p>&mdash;No olvide que en Sud América flotamos sobre un mar subterráneo de
petróleo,&mdash;observó sonriendo el señor Jiménez.&mdash;Pero con todo,&mdash;añadió,
cambiando de tono,&mdash;admito que la producción de la fuerza eléctrica
siempre representará una economía.</p>

<p>&mdash;Analicemos ahora&mdash;interrumpió mister Smith&mdash;la parte<a name="page_119" id="page_119"></a> relativa al
intercambio. ¿Qué productos nos enviaría la América latina?</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Sabía Ud.&mdash;exclamó el señor Souza a manera de<a name="FNanchor_23_719" id="FNanchor_23_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_719" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> respuesta&mdash;que el
Brasil tiene los mayores depósitos de mineral de hierro que se conocen;
un hierro casi libre de todo rastro de<a name="FNanchor_24_720" id="FNanchor_24_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_720" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> fósforo, y al que se calcula
un rendimiento de setenta por ciento?</p>

<p>&mdash;Pero ese depósito pronto se agotará,&mdash;dijo Jiménez, haciendo una
guiñada de inteligencia<a name="FNanchor_25_721" id="FNanchor_25_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_721" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> a sus amigos.</p>

<p>&mdash;Sólo en el estado de Minas Geraes tenemos cerca de dos mil millones de
toneladas,&mdash;replicó el brasileño con viveza, tomando la broma en
serio.<a name="FNanchor_26_722" id="FNanchor_26_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_722" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>&mdash;Y no cuento los yacimientos de hierro que hay en otros
estados.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Quedan esas minas muy alejadas de los puertos de embarque?&mdash;preguntó
mister Smith con interés.</p>

<p>&mdash;A menos de cuatrocientas millas de la costa&mdash;le contestó Souza.</p>

<p>&mdash;Si eso es así&mdash;repuso mister Smith,&mdash;nuestras fundiciones podrían
llegar a ser clientes exclusivos de esas minas, porque dentro de poco la
producción de acero en los Estados Unidos va a alcanzar cifras
estupendas. También la Europa necesitará ese mineral para mezclarlo con
los suyos, menos puros.</p>

<p>&mdash;Mi país,&mdash;continuó el señor Souza&mdash;es el que produce más manganeso,
después de la India. Ya sabe Ud. cuán enorme es la demanda de manganeso
para la industria del acero.</p>

<p>&mdash;Por nuestra parte&mdash;intervino Enríquez, ingeniero chileno,&mdash;poseemos
los mayores depósitos de nitrato que existen en el mundo y, como Ud. no
lo ignora, ese producto, además<a name="page_120" id="page_120"></a> de ser un abono excelente, es un
elemento indispensable<a name="FNanchor_27_723" id="FNanchor_27_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_723" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> para la fabricación de la pólvora.</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Hum, hum!&mdash;murmuró mister Smith, rascándose la cabeza<a name="FNanchor_28_724" id="FNanchor_28_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_724" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>&mdash;eso me
gusta menos.<a name="FNanchor_29_725" id="FNanchor_29_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_725" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Ud. comprenderá, sin duda, señor Enríquez, que nuestro
país tendría reparos en depender del extranjero para la provisión de una
substancia tan preciosa<a name="FNanchor_30_726" id="FNanchor_30_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_726" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> para la defensa nacional en caso de guerra.
Yo estoy por la fabricación artificial de los nitratos y creo que mi
país debiera instalar en el Niágara una planta eléctrica para su
elaboración.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Por qué en el Niágara?&mdash;preguntaron varios a la vez.</p>

<p>&mdash;Porque para la fabricación del nitrato es indispensable el alto calor
de los inmensos hornos eléctricos&mdash;contestó mister Smith.&mdash;Sin embargo,
no creo que esta forma costosa de fabricación se usara en la preparación
de nitrato para abonos, de los cuales, por otra parte, no podemos
prescindir. Es ocioso pensar en<a name="FNanchor_31_727" id="FNanchor_31_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_727" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> aumentar nuestra producción agrícola
si no acrecentamos la productividad del suelo, toda vez que<a name="FNanchor_32_728" id="FNanchor_32_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_728" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
carecemos ya de tierras baldías que pudieran utilizarse para satisfacer
la creciente demanda de productos agrícolas.</p>

<p>&mdash;Tratándose de productos que sería posible importar en los Estados
Unidos&mdash;dijo a este punto el señor Bustamente, comerciante
boliviano,&mdash;no debe Ud. olvidar nuestro estaño. Bolivia concurre con el
diez y ocho por ciento de la producción mundial de ese metal, y que los
Estados Unidos reciben ahora de Oriente....<a name="page_121" id="page_121"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;... corriendo el riesgo de que su paso por el canal de Suez se vea
dificultado en tiempo de guerra&mdash;agregó mister Smith, completando la
frase.</p>

<p>&mdash;Lo mismo digo de nuestro cobre y de nuestra plata,&mdash;continuó el señor
Bustamente&mdash;aunque esos metales existen asimismo en Chile y el Perú. Han
de saber Uds. que la meseta boliviana es una de las regiones más ricas
en minerales que existen en el planeta, y que, atendiendo a la situación
incierta de Méjico, ofrece una buena oportunidad a los capitalistas y
mineros norteamericanos.</p>

<p>&mdash;A propósito del Oriente,&mdash;dijo el señor Souza&mdash;¿no le parece a Ud. que
los Estados Unidos que ahora importan algún caucho de África, podrían
abastecerse de ese producto exclusivamente en el Brazil?</p>

<p>&mdash;Pero entiendo que la goma del Brasil es más cara que la de África....</p>

<p>&mdash;Es verdad que hasta hace poco nuestro caucho se cotizaba a precios
casi prohibitivos; pero esa alza fué pasajera. Reconoció diversas causas
como son los métodos inadecuados, jornales y sueldos demasiado elevados
y utilización incompleta del producto. Pero, gracias a la aplicación de
métodos científicos y al empleo de obreros de Ceará y Rio Grande do
Norte, la situación se ha normalizado.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Queda mucha goma aún?&mdash;preguntó Jiménez.</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Que si queda!<a name="FNanchor_33_729" id="FNanchor_33_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_729" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>&mdash;exclamó el brasileño, levantando las manos en
alto.<a name="FNanchor_34_730" id="FNanchor_34_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_730" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>&mdash;¡Con decir a Uds.<a name="FNanchor_35_731" id="FNanchor_35_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_731" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> que en la actualidad el comercio se
hace por los ríos y sólo se explotan los bosques contiguos! Tierra
adentro<a name="FNanchor_36_732" id="FNanchor_36_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_732" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> las selvas de <i>borracha</i> están intactas.<a name="page_122" id="page_122"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;¡Excelente oportunidad!&mdash;observó mister Smith. Si bien se mira,<a name="FNanchor_37_733" id="FNanchor_37_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_733" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> la
región del Amazonas está más cerca de los Estados Unidos que el
África.... ¿Viene también de su país, señor Souza, esa madera tan útil
que se llama quebracho?</p>

<p>&mdash;Tenemos ese árbol y, además, inmensos bosques de otros árboles que
contienen mucho tanino en la corteza y en las hojas; pero el comercio de
quebracho está especialmente desarrollado en una zona de la Argentina
más próxima a los puertos,&mdash;agregó el señor Souza.&mdash;¿No es así, doctor
Mendoza?</p>

<p>&mdash;Es exacto lo que Ud. dice,&mdash;replicó éste.&mdash;Y he de observar que esa
planta crece en una área limitada. Los europeos tienen casi monopolizada
la industria de la extracción del tanino, el cual se emplea en el
curtido del cuero; pero todavía quedan grandes superficies forestales
que podrían abastecer con tanino a todas las curtidurías de los Estados
Unidos.</p>

<p>&mdash;A propósito de la Argentina, cuyo nombre trae a la mente la idea de
ganados numerosos&mdash;dijo mister Smith,&mdash;han de saber Uds. que las tierras
adecuadas para apacentar rebaños en nuestro país son más escasas cada
día, a causa de las exigencias de la agricultura. La merma en nuestra
riqueza ganadera ha adquirido proporciones tales, que ya la demanda de
carne supera a la oferta. Ya importamos carne, cosa que hace veinte años
habría parecido ridículo predecir. Solamente en la América latina quedan
todavía tierras baldías que pueden destinarse al pastoreo.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Y en el Canadá y Siberia?&mdash;preguntó el boliviano.</p>

<p>&mdash;El clima es allí demasiado frío,&mdash;contestó Smith.&mdash;Y en Australia y el
Sur de África la lluvia es insuficiente para mantener los prados donde
se apacenta el ganado.<a name="page_123" id="page_123"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;Por ese motivo, las regiones que Ud. acaba de mencionar<a name="FNanchor_38_734" id="FNanchor_38_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_734" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> no
comenzarían a explotarse sino después que los fértiles prados
sudamericanos hubieran sido ocupados,&mdash;observó el señor Mendoza.</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Ya va largo!<a name="FNanchor_39_735" id="FNanchor_39_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_735" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>&mdash;exclamó el señor Souza.&mdash;La América del Sur puede
ofrecer una superficie inmensa, que comprende no solamente la Argentina
sino también el Brasil, la parte este de Bolivia y todo el Paraguay.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Y el Uruguay?&mdash;preguntó mister Smith.</p>

<p>&mdash;Puede decirse que<a name="FNanchor_40_736" id="FNanchor_40_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_736" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> ha alcanzado ya la máxima cifra de ganado que
puede soportar.</p>

<p>&mdash;Todo eso está muy bueno,<a name="FNanchor_41_737" id="FNanchor_41_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_737" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>&mdash;dijo sonriendo el señor Matienzo, que
hasta entonces no había hablado;&mdash;pero de nada valdría<a name="FNanchor_42_738" id="FNanchor_42_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_738" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> el que los
Estados Unidos poseyeran las fuentes de abastecimiento de sus mercados
si al mismo tiempo no dispusieran de una marina mercante para el
transporte de los productos.</p>

<p>&mdash;Estoy con Ud.&mdash;dijo mister Smith. Y luego agregó en tono grave:&mdash;Y si
las relaciones internacionales no se organizan<a name="FNanchor_43_739" id="FNanchor_43_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_739" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> de acuerdo con el
ideal universal de paz, mucho me temo<a name="FNanchor_44_740" id="FNanchor_44_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_740" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> que la América toda, y no sólo
la del norte, necesite una marina de guerra bastante poderosa para
defender su independencia económica.<a name="page_124" id="page_124"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;Pero con marina de guerra y todo,<a name="FNanchor_45_741" id="FNanchor_45_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_741" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>&mdash;dijo el boliviano,&mdash;yo preveo
una dificultad, y es<a name="FNanchor_46_742" id="FNanchor_46_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_742" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> la desproporción entre las importaciones y las
exportaciones de los Estados Unidos.</p>

<p>&mdash;Tiene razón el señor<a name="FNanchor_47_743" id="FNanchor_47_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_743" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Bustamente,&mdash;asintió mister Smith.&mdash;Nuestras
importaciones han sido siempre de menor peso y volumen que las
exportaciones. Hemos importado cacao, café y goma, que requieren poco
tonelaje, y en cambio hemos exportado trigo, maíz y, hasta hace poco,
carne, que ocupan mayor espacio. Pero el equilibrio se establecería si
Uds. nos mandasen el mineral de hierro y manganeso del Brasil....</p>

<p>&mdash;Y la carne, el quebracho, la lana y el lino de la Argentina,&mdash;agregó
el señor Mendoza.</p>

<p>&mdash;Y nuestro nitrato y nuestro cobre...&mdash;añadió por su parte<a name="FNanchor_48_744" id="FNanchor_48_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_744" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> el señor
Enríquez.</p>

<p>&mdash;Y nuestro estaño y nuestra plata,...&mdash;apuntó el boliviano.</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Pero, señores!<a name="FNanchor_49_745" id="FNanchor_49_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_745" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>&mdash;exclamó riendo el norteamericano,&mdash;¡a ese
paso<a name="FNanchor_50_746" id="FNanchor_50_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_746" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> los papeles se trocarán<a name="FNanchor_51_747" id="FNanchor_51_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_747" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> y el déficit en el tonelaje estará
en contra de nuestras exportaciones para Sud América!</p>

<p>Todos rieron de buena gana,<a name="FNanchor_52_748" id="FNanchor_52_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_748" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> pero el señor Martínez, calmando a sus
amigos con un gesto, dijo:<a name="page_125" id="page_125"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;Para llenar ese déficit está el carbón.<a name="FNanchor_53_749" id="FNanchor_53_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_749" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> El carbón ha suministrado
las tres quintas partes de las exportaciones de la Gran Bretaña para la
América latina. Ese producto ha sido el compensador de los fletes
marítimos de esa nación, y le ha permitido conservar la preponderancia
comercial en el mundo entero. ¿Por qué no habría de<a name="FNanchor_54_750" id="FNanchor_54_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_750" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> asegurar ahora
la de los Estados Unidos en el continente?</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>XXV.&mdash;FRUTAS<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h3>

<p>&mdash;Don Enrique, que acaba de regresar<a name="FNanchor_1_751" id="FNanchor_1_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_751" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> de su gira, me cuenta que en los
comercios de frutas de Sud América vió manzanas y duraznos de
California. ¿Qué me dices de esto?<a name="FNanchor_2_752" id="FNanchor_2_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_752" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>&mdash;Tiene razón don Enrique. Los agricultores de la América latina han
dado siempre la preferencia a los cultivos de más inmediato
beneficio.<a name="FNanchor_3_753" id="FNanchor_3_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_753" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Por esa razón se han preocupado poco de mejorar la calidad
de las frutas.</p>

<p>&mdash;Yo suponía que el clima de esos países no era favorable al cultivo de
las especies frutales comunes a Europa y Estados Unidos.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Has olvidado ya tu geografía? En Sud América, en la parte austral
sobre todo, el clima es favorable al crecimiento del manzano, del peral
y otros árboles frutales de la zona templada.<a name="page_126" id="page_126"></a> El naranjo prospera en
todo el continente. Las naranjas de Bahía en el Brasil, las del Paraguay
y las de Corrientes y la Rioja en la Argentina son justamente famosas.
Las primeras, como tú sabes, son de tamaño más que mediano<a name="FNanchor_4_754" id="FNanchor_4_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_754" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> y no
tienen semillas. Otra fruta aclimatada de antiguo<a name="FNanchor_5_755" id="FNanchor_5_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_755" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> en Sud América es
la uva. Chile, Argentina, el Uruguay, el sur del Brasil y el Perú tienen
grandes viñedos.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Uva para vino o para la mesa?</p>

<p>&mdash;De ambas clases. La de Chile da un vino superior al argentino; pero
como fruta de mesa es inferior a la del país vecino.</p>

<p>&mdash;Confieso que ignoraba se produjese vino en el continente, fuera de
California.</p>

<p>&mdash;Pero te sorprenderás mucho más al saber que la producción de vino de
California es casi tres veces menor que la de Argentina, y apenas excede
a la de Chile.</p>

<p>&mdash;Está visto que<a name="FNanchor_6_756" id="FNanchor_6_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_756" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> en tratándose de Sud América nunca se está a
cubierto de<a name="FNanchor_7_757" id="FNanchor_7_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_757" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> sorpresas.</p>

<p>&mdash;Volviendo a las frutas de mesa, sabrás que el melocotón, que llaman
comunmente durazno, se produce bien en el centro del Brasil, en el sur
del Paraguay, en el Uruguay, la Argentina y Chile. En estos dos últimos
países, hacia el sur y a ambos lados de los Andes, hay espléndidos
huertos de manzanos; pero la explotación de esa fruta se hace en muy
pequeña escala, a pesar de las excelentes condiciones del suelo y del
clima.</p>

<p>&mdash;Probablemente el cultivo de la fruta satisface sólo las necesidades<a name="page_127" id="page_127"></a>
del consumo local y todavía no responde a un vasto plan de exportación.</p>

<p>&mdash;Te engañas.<a name="FNanchor_8_758" id="FNanchor_8_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_758" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> El comercio de naranjas es muy activo, así por los ríos
como por las costas del Atlántico; la mandarina, que se produce en la
zona del Plata, se disemina en una región considerable. A orillas del
Tigre, en la Argentina, y en las cercanías de Rancagua y de Santiago, en
Chile, hay grandes establecimientos para la preparación de frutas en
conserva. El tráfico de uva es asimismo muy intenso, y en la época de la
vendimia corren trenes especiales entre Buenos Aires y los centros
productores de esa fruta en los Andes. En el invierno, puedes comer esa
misma uva, tan fresca como si acabara de ser cogida,<a name="FNanchor_9_759" id="FNanchor_9_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_759" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> en los grandes
hoteles de Nueva York... si te hallas dispuesto a pagar algunos dólares
por cada racimo. Tú ves, por este solo dato, cuán generosas son las
recompensas que recibe la iniciativa comercial, y cuán inesperadas
oportunidades tiene el intercambio continental de los productos del
suelo. He aquí una, gracias a la cual en un hemisferio fuera de estación
se puede consumir la fruta fresca del otro.</p>

<p>&mdash;Me sorprendes. Yo creía que todo el tráfico internacional de fruta se
reducía a la importación de plátanos o bananas y toronjas, y a la
exportación de manzanas.</p>

<p>&mdash;Ya ves como estabas en error. Y a propósito de la banana, ¿no te has
percatado de que esa fruta es un factor eficaz de panamericanismo?</p>

<p>&mdash;¿De panamericanismo, dices?</p>

<p>&mdash;Y lo repito. No te rías.<a name="FNanchor_10_760" id="FNanchor_10_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_760" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> La banana representa en el intercambio<a name="page_128" id="page_128"></a>
continental americano lo que las especias representaron en un tiempo en
el tráfico entre Europa y Asia: un vínculo de amistad y de recíproco
entendimiento, que facilitó la compenetración de dos civilizaciones.</p>

<p>&mdash;Don Enrique expresaba una idea semejante, y me decía que, viajando por
Centro América, se descubren por todas partes signos de actividad
relacionada con el comercio de banana, en el cual los norteamericanos
han invertido enormes capitales.</p>

<p>&mdash;Y esas actividades económicas llevan necesariamente aparejadas<a name="FNanchor_11_761" id="FNanchor_11_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_761" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
otras de orden social: manifestaciones de la civilización de un pueblo
superior. Por una parte las plantaciones científicamente administradas,
las poblaciones rurales saneadas, constituyen un ejemplo altamente
sugerente, y el orden que reina en esas comarcas ha ejercido una
influencia saludable en la administración pública. Por la otra, en lo
que se refiere a las personas, el desahogo económico, la salud y el
bienestar que son el resultado de una transformación inteligente del
medio social, no pueden menos de ganar adeptos cada día.</p>

<p>Ya ves qué de<a name="FNanchor_12_762" id="FNanchor_12_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_762" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> consecuencias se desprenden de un fenómeno, al parecer
trivial.<a name="FNanchor_13_763" id="FNanchor_13_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_763" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Y no paran aquéllas aquí, pues el extranjero, por su parte,
aprende en esas tierras que explota a apreciar las cualidades del nativo
educado, su alto idealismo y su entusiasmo por las cosas que interesan a
la inteligencia y al sentimiento.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>XXVI.&mdash;CARNE Y LANA<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h3>

<p>&mdash;Le explicaré a Ud. la historia del comercio de carnes en dos palabras.
Antes de inventarse los procedimientos de congelación que permiten el
embarque de carne fresca, los países de la zona templada&mdash;que es donde
prosperan los ganados&mdash;enviaban a los distritos tropicales la carne seca
en forma de tasajo. Brasil y Cuba consumían este producto en cantidades
considerables para alimentar a los obreros negros de sus haciendas.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿De cuáles países se remitía el tasajo?</p>

<p>&mdash;De los saladeros del Uruguay y de la Argentina; y se obtenía del
beneficio de animales bovinos de calidad inferior, conocidos con el
nombre de «criollos,» de que se componía la mayor parte del ganado de
las haciendas. Cuando la remisión de carnes frescas fué posible, se
presentó el problema de refinar las razas a fin de producir carnes de
calidad superior, y con ese objeto los «cabañeros» o criadores del Río
de la Plata compraron en Inglaterra toros de pura sangre. (Llegó el caso
de venderse, hace poco, un solo animal<a name="FNanchor_1_764" id="FNanchor_1_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_764" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> por treinta mil libras
esterlinas, o sean 150,000 pesos oro.) Desde ese tiempo las razas
bovinas han evolucionado notablemente.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Se exporta tasajo todavía?</p>

<p>&mdash;Sí; pero en cantidad decreciente. Por suerte la demanda de carne para
tasajo no ha cesado nunca, y este hecho ha impedido se produjera<a name="FNanchor_2_765" id="FNanchor_2_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_765" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> una
crisis en el negocio de ganado, como habría sucedido si la raza criolla
se hubiera depreciado por falta<a name="page_130" id="page_130"></a> de mercado al comenzar la demanda de
animales de razas superiores.</p>

<p>&mdash;El Río de la Plata produce también mucha carne de oveja. ¿Cuál es la
situación de esa industria con respecto a la de la lana?</p>

<p>&mdash;Ud. sabe que la lana fina procede por lo general de ovejas de cuerpo
endeble y liviano.</p>

<p>&mdash;De la raza merino, por ejemplo.</p>

<p>&mdash;Justamente. Las ovejas corpulentas y que por lo tanto son productoras
de carne dan, en cambio, lanas gruesas y ordinarias. Por eso, hace
algunos años, los criadores ingleses lograron imponer en el mercado de
lanas las procedentes de las ovejas <i>cheviot</i>, que se crían en Escocia
desde tiempo inmemorial,<a name="FNanchor_3_766" id="FNanchor_3_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_766" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> con el objeto de beneficiar su carne.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿No había ovejas de esta raza en Sud América?</p>

<p>&mdash;Ahora verá Ud.<a name="FNanchor_4_767" id="FNanchor_4_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_767" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Antes de que se inventaran los procedimientos de
refrigeración que hace posible la exportación de carne helada y
congelada, los criadores sudamericanos sólo se interesaban en la
producción de lana, y a fin de mejorar gradualmente la calidad de ésta,
cruzaban sus ovejas criollas con reproductores merinos.</p>

<p>&mdash;Debido a lo cual<a name="FNanchor_5_768" id="FNanchor_5_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_768" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> la corpulencia de las ovejas sudamericanas tal vez
fué haciéndose<a name="FNanchor_6_769" id="FNanchor_6_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_769" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> inferior a la requerida para el comercio de carnes.<a name="page_131" id="page_131"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;Precisamente. El problema fué entonces, y sigue siendo todavía,<a name="FNanchor_7_770" id="FNanchor_7_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_770" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> el
de combinar la producción de lana con la de carne, de tal modo que<a name="FNanchor_8_771" id="FNanchor_8_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_771" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> el
mismo animal ofrezca un buen rendimiento de ambas.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿No se importaron moruecos ingleses?</p>

<p>&mdash;En exceso, al punto que<a name="FNanchor_9_772" id="FNanchor_9_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_772" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> hoy día el setenta y cinco por ciento de
las lanas en la Argentina procede de <i>lincolns</i> y <i>leicesters</i>, puros o
cruzados con merinos. Pero aunque el rendimiento de carne ha mejorado,
no ha ocurrido lo mismo<a name="FNanchor_10_773" id="FNanchor_10_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_773" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> con la calidad de la lana, razón por la cual
los criadores o cabañeros inteligentes procuran crear un tipo nativo
que, a la abundancia de carne, reuna la buena calidad de la lana.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Cómo se procede a la venta de las lanas en el Río de la Plata?</p>

<p>&mdash;Los vellones se remiten a los mercados de frutos. Allí reciben la lana
consignatarios o comisionistas, quienes, de acuerdo con sus clientes,
procuran obtener por ellas el precio más alto.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Y quiénes son los compradores?</p>

<p>&mdash;Los agentes de las fábricas de tejidos de Europa y Estados Unidos. Del
mercado de frutos pasa la lana a los almacenes, donde se la clasifica y
embala o empaqueta en fardos para ser exportada a Francia, Bélgica,
Alemania y Estados Unidos.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Se vende la lana en bruto, o lavada?</p>

<p>&mdash;En bruto, o sucia, para emplear el término corriente; esto es, con la
grasa o <i>jubre</i>. Por consiguiente, los compradores deben tener
suficiente práctica para apreciar el rendimiento de la<a name="page_132" id="page_132"></a> lana que
compran; es decir, el peso a que quedará reducida una vez lavada. Este
rendimiento oscila entre el treinta y el setenta por ciento, según la
clase del textil y las condiciones en que el animal ha vivido.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿No se teje la lana en la Argentina?</p>

<p>&mdash;En parte solamente. Se hila la lana para fabricar prendas de calidad
inferior, aunque también se tejen géneros finos; pero para este objeto
se importa la lana hilada. Es esa otra de las oportunidades que ofrece
Sud América, pues ha de saber Ud. que en la actualidad<a name="FNanchor_11_774" id="FNanchor_11_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_774" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> se introduce
anualmente lana hilada y tejida por valor de muchos millones de dólares.</p>

<p>&mdash;Vengo ahora mismo<a name="FNanchor_16_790" id="FNanchor_16_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_790" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> de allí; quedaban todos buenos ¿Cómo van
esos<a name="FNanchor_17_791" id="FNanchor_17_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_791" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> proyectos?</p>

<p>&mdash;Así no más.<a name="FNanchor_18_792" id="FNanchor_18_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_792" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Precisamente te llamaba para pedirte ciertos datos con
el objeto de transmitirlos adonde tú sabes<a name="FNanchor_19_793" id="FNanchor_19_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_793" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> en la esperanza de
constituir la compañía telefónica de que te hablé hace algunos meses.</p>

<p>&mdash;Estoy a tus órdenes. ¿Qué datos deseas conocer?</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Sabes tú<a name="FNanchor_20_794" id="FNanchor_20_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_794" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> si en algún país o por lo menos en alguna ciudad de la
América latina el gobierno administra los teléfonos?<a name="page_135" id="page_135"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;En este momento sólo recuerdo el caso de Río de Janeiro. Pero es la
excepción, pues como tú sabes, casi todas las líneas telefónicas de
estos países están en manos de compañías particulares.</p>

<p>&mdash;Inglesas todas, me imagino....</p>

<p>&mdash;Las hay francesas, también; en Bolivia por ejemplo. En Centro América
y Antillas hay compañías norteamericanas.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Tienes tú algún otro<a name="FNanchor_21_795" id="FNanchor_21_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_795" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> dato sobre las utilidades que dan los
capitales aplicados a estas empresas?</p>

<p>&mdash;Ninguno importante que yo recuerde. ¡Ah, sí! Hace poco se publicó la
memoria de la Compañía de Teléfonos del Río de la Plata, y en ella se
declara una ganancia neta de novecientos mil pesos oro.</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Caramba!<a name="FNanchor_22_796" id="FNanchor_22_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_796" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> ¿Sobre qué capital?</p>

<p>&mdash;De diez millones. Conviene saber que las acciones ordinarias de esa
empresa están dando ocho por ciento desde hace algunos años.</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Bravo!<a name="FNanchor_23_797" id="FNanchor_23_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_797" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Pero mis capitalistas<a name="FNanchor_24_798" id="FNanchor_24_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_798" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> son un poco escépticos, y tanto
que estoy por mandarlos a paseo.<a name="FNanchor_25_799" id="FNanchor_25_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_799" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Manifiestan dudas sobre los
beneficios de una línea telefónica tan larga como la que yo les
propongo.<a name="page_136" id="page_136"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;Recuérdales<a name="FNanchor_26_800" id="FNanchor_26_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_800" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> que Río de Janeiro está comunicado con Petrópolis,
Teresópolis y Nictheroy; que en el Perú hay una línea de doscientos
kilómetros y en Chile una casi tan larga; y que desde Buenos Aires
pueden ya hablar a puntos casi a mil kilómetros distantes. Creen también
que el teléfono... (<i>no corte,</i><a name="FNanchor_27_801" id="FNanchor_27_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_801" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> <i>señorita</i>)... que el teléfono está
muy explotado; que ya ha ocupado las principales posiciones, como si
dijéramos.</p>

<p>&mdash;Convengo en que sería difícil para una compañía completamente extraña
reunir un núcleo de abonados suficientemente grande e importante como
para inducir a los abonados de otras compañías a abandonar el servicio
que de ellas reciben. Pero mucho puede hacer una propaganda inteligente,
basada en métodos liberales.</p>

<p>&mdash;Sí; recuerdo haberte oído decir que en una ciudad de Estados Unidos,
cierta compañía, deseando suplantar a otra ya establecida, instaló
gratuitamente sus aparatos&mdash;que eran más perfeccionados que los de la
empresa competidora&mdash;en los domicilios de los abonados de éstas,
concediéndoles un servicio gratis por tres meses, a título de
prueba<a name="FNanchor_28_802" id="FNanchor_28_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_802" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>....</p>

<p>&mdash;Ya recuerdo. Y al cabo de esos tres meses, los abonados se encontraron
con que el muy astuto<a name="FNanchor_29_803" id="FNanchor_29_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_803" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> del<a name="FNanchor_30_804" id="FNanchor_30_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_804" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> intruso contaba con la clientela del
rival, aumentada con algunos miles de nuevos abonados. Yo no aconsejaría
esos procedimientos que, por otra parte, no podrían implantarse sin
estudiar la forma en que están hechas las concesiones en estos países.
Pero aparte de<a name="page_137" id="page_137"></a> eso, hay otros campos inexplotados todavía en el
servicio de teléfonos. Tú podrías llamar la atención a esos caballeros
hacia el hecho que en la América latina el servicio público telefónico
de las casas de comercio no puede decirse que responda a un plan
económico inteligente. Las compañías no han entrado en arreglos con los
comerciantes a fin de interesarlos en que el público use sus aparatos. A
consecuencia de esta deficiencia no se han multiplicado, ni mucho
menos,<a name="FNanchor_31_805" id="FNanchor_31_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_805" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> las estaciones telefónicas privadas en las casas de comercio,
ni el comerciante mira con buenos ojos<a name="FNanchor_32_806" id="FNanchor_32_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_806" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> el que sus aparatos sean
usados por extraños.</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Hombre!<a name="FNanchor_33_807" id="FNanchor_33_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_807" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Ese es un buen aliciente. Completaré mi propuesta
acompañándola con nuevos argumentos y datos. Gracias por tus
observaciones.</p>

<p>&mdash;No hay de qué.<a name="FNanchor_34_808" id="FNanchor_34_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_808" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Recuerdos a<a name="FNanchor_35_809" id="FNanchor_35_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_809" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> la familia.</p>

irregularities being suppressed. The Subjunctive forms become: <i>amés</i>,
<i>temás</i>, <i>partás</i>, respectively, and the Imperative is formed by simply
dropping the last letter of the infinitive: <i>amá</i>, <i>temé</i>, <i>partí</i>.
According to this interesting tendency, the form <i>eres</i> becomes <i>sos</i>.

<br />
Muy señores míos<a name="FNanchor_1_813" id="FNanchor_1_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_813" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>:<br />
</p>

<p>En contestación a su carta en que piden informes sobre el estado del
teatro en la América latina, me es agradable dar a Uds. los datos que
siguen.</p>

<p>Todas las capitales latino-americanas se distinguen por el número y
calidad de sus teatros y lugares de diversión. Acabo de saber que en
Buenos Aires los concurrentes a los teatros pasaron de cinco millones en
un año. En esa ciudad el Teatro Colón, administrado por la
Municipalidad, es uno de los coliseos más grandes del mundo, pues tiene
capacidad para unos 3500 espectadores. Se adapta a grandes espectáculos
porque su escenario es vasto y está muy bien aparejado de la maquinaria
para obtener una <i>mise en scène</i><a name="FNanchor_2_814" id="FNanchor_2_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_814" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> irreprochable.</p>

<p>En la América latina el espectáculo teatral por excelencia es la ópera.
Los elencos o cuadros de las compañías son siempre discretos y a veces
notables y en sus primeras partes<a name="FNanchor_3_815" id="FNanchor_3_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_815" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> suelen figurar nombres de
cantatrices,<a name="FNanchor_4_816" id="FNanchor_4_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_816" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> tenores, barítonos o bajos famosos. La primera
representación<a name="FNanchor_5_817" id="FNanchor_5_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_817" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> atrae siempre una concurrencia<a name="page_139" id="page_139"></a> numerosa y muy
selecta. La temporada dura tres o más meses, durante el invierno,
alternándose las funciones de abono con las ordinarias. Es costumbre
destinar un día de la semana como día de moda, en que se dan funciones
también llamadas de moda. En días especiales, como son los aniversarios
patrióticos, se dan espectáculos extraordinarios o de gala. El
repertorio de estas compañías consiste en las obras más sobresalientes
del teatro lírico antiguo y moderno. Los precios de las localidades
varían según los países y los teatros. El palco <i>avant-scène</i> es la
localidad más cara, siguiéndole luego el palco bajo, el palco alto, las
butacas o tertulias de orquesta, las plateas, las tertulias altas y el
paraíso, el cual puede ser numerado o consistir en lo que se llama
gradas, dispuestas en anfiteatros. En Chile y Argentina se llama
<i>cazuela</i> y en Méjico <i>galería</i> a una localidad especialmente destinada
a las señoras. Es interesante saber que en Cuba se da el nombre de
cazuela al paraíso o galería superior, donde, precisamente, no concurren
mujeres. Los precios para un estreno son generalmente más altos que para
una <i>réprise</i> o repetición.</p>

<p>Los grandes teatros líricos del continente, después del Colón, son la
Gran Opera de Río de Janeiro, construida según el modelo de la de París,
el Teatro Municipal de San Pablo (Brasil), cuyo costo pasa de siete
millones de pesos, el teatro de San José de Costa Rica, que es uno de
los más hermosos del continente, el Teatro Municipal de Santiago de
Chile, el Solís de Montevideo, el Nacional de la Habana y muchos otros.</p>

<p>Hay teatros destinados a otra clase de espectáculos, como zarzuelas,
óperas cómicas o bufas, operetas y <i>vaudevilles</i>. Algunos de estos
juguetes líricos, se mantienen largo tiempo en el cartel y son de gran
espectáculo por su juego escénico, sus <i>ballets</i> y la brillante
indumentaria de sus masas corales. Los teatros<a name="page_140" id="page_140"></a> que para tales
representaciones están construidos suelen tener orquestas de más de cien
músicos.</p>

<p>Son comunes en la América latina las obras dramáticas en prosa y verso,
aunque más las primeras que las segundas. A este género de producción
pertenece la comedia y el drama, ya sea antiguo o moderno. La comedia de
enredo y de costumbres es más popular que la alta comedia, el drama de
época, o las piezas dramáticas modernas,&mdash;sobre todo los llamados dramas
de tesis. Se prefiere el teatro moderno al clásico. El melodrama ha
pasado de moda.</p>

<p>&mdash;Algunos teatros dan funciones por secciones o por tandas, como se las
llaman en Chile, Perú y Méjico, y una de tales secciones, que tiene
lugar en la tarde, se llama sección <i>vermut</i>, por ser esa la hora a que
generalmente se toma un aperitivo. Estas representaciones consisten en
el género chico o sea comedias, juguetes cómicos, proverbios, sainetes,
petipiezas, cuadros y bocetos cómicos, apropósitos en prosa y verso,
variedades y revistas cómicas, parodias, etc. No dejan de figurar
actores y actrices de nota<a name="FNanchor_6_818" id="FNanchor_6_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_818" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> en los repartos de tales espectáculos. El
primer actor, la primera dama, la característica, el galán joven y otros
repartos suelen ser extraordinariamente populares.</p>

<p>Hay otros teatros adaptados especialmente a espectáculos de diferente
género. En los circos trabajan compañías que hacen giras por varias
ciudades. El espectáculo consiste casi siempre en ejercicios acrobáticos
y ecuestres en el picadero. Hay también salas para conciertos
sinfónicos, que atraen un público selecto.</p>

<p>Los artistas de primer orden reciben altos salarios en la América
latina. El Colón de Buenos Aires ha pagado hasta 7500<a name="page_141" id="page_141"></a> pesos por
noche<a name="FNanchor_7_819" id="FNanchor_7_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_819" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> a un artista de fama universal; lo que bastará a Uds. para
comprender que el público latino-americano paga buenos precios cuando se
le ofrecen espectáculos escogidos.</p>

<p>Dejando contestadas sus preguntas, me repito de Uds.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>XXIX.&mdash;TRANVÍAS ELÉCTRICOS<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h3>

<p>&mdash;¿Se construirán alguna vez tranvías eléctricos subterráneos en las
ciudades latino-americanas como los tienen Nueva York, Londres, París,
Berlín y Viena?</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Qué atrasado de noticias está Ud.!<a name="FNanchor_1_820" id="FNanchor_1_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_820" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> En Buenos Aires funciona ya un
subterráneo y hay dos más en construcción, aparte de uno especial para
carga.</p>

<p>&mdash;Me sorprende Ud., por cierto. ¿Fué construido ese subterráneo con
capitales americanos?</p>

<p>&mdash;No, señor. La compañía que lo hizo y lo administra es inglesa, la
misma que con el nombre de Anglo-Argentina y desde hace muchos años
explota una de las líneas de tranvías más poderosas de Sud América.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Qué extensión tiene aquel subterráneo?</p>

<p>&mdash;Cuando estén terminados todos los ramales que se encuentran en
construcción (porque hasta ahora no están en servicio<a name="page_142" id="page_142"></a> ni aun la mitad),
tendrá una longitud total de quince millas, más o menos.</p>

<p>&mdash;Ya que<a name="FNanchor_2_821" id="FNanchor_2_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_821" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> habla Ud. de tranvías ¿subsiste aún el sistema de tracción
de sangre?<a name="FNanchor_3_822" id="FNanchor_3_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_822" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>&mdash;En las grandes ciudades del Atlántico y del Pacífico impera el sistema
de tracción eléctrica. En algunas ciudades interiores del Brasil y en
los países del norte subsisten algunas líneas que utilizan todavía el
caballo y la mula.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Hay campo para<a name="FNanchor_4_823" id="FNanchor_4_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_823" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> la instalación de nuevas líneas eléctricas?</p>

<p>&mdash;Ciertamente. El <i>tramway</i><a name="FNanchor_5_824" id="FNanchor_5_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_824" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> eléctrico invade constantemente nuevas
zonas en los suburbios de las ciudades. Aunque Buenos Aires tiene ya
cuatrocientas millas de tranvías eléctricos, constantemente se extiende
el recorrido.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Qué tal<a name="FNanchor_6_825" id="FNanchor_6_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_825" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> está el Brasil a este respectó?</p>

<p>&mdash;Admirablemente bien servido. Río de Janeiro, Belén, San Pablo, Manaos
y algunas otras ciudades tienen buenas líneas de tranvías eléctricos.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Es fácil obtener subvenciones o primas para las empresas que se
establecen?</p>

<p>&mdash;Pudiera ocurrir en alguna región donde el tráfico no puede sostener
por sí solo los gastos de la empresa; pero en ciudades como Buenos
Aires, en la que sólo una compañía transporta al año más de
cuatrocientos millones de pasajeros y donde ya se<a name="page_143" id="page_143"></a> han invertido más de
cien millones de pesos en la instalación de esos servicios, no son
necesarios los incentivos artificiales para atraer los capitales. Al
contrario, la prosperidad de las empresas permíteles soportar
contribuciones que en otros tiempos habrían sido consideradas gravosas.
Tienen que contribuir a las rentas municipales con el seis por ciento de
las entradas brutas y con un impuesto de cincuenta pesos por cada cuadra
de línea sencilla<a name="FNanchor_7_826" id="FNanchor_7_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_826" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> en las calles pavimentadas. Además, las compañías
deben pagar la cuarta parte del costo del repavimento y de la reparación
de las calles por donde pasan las líneas. Aparte de todo esto, se les
impone una contribución de 5% por milla sobre la propiedad.</p>

<p>&mdash;Es sorprendente la previsión que revelan esas cláusulas y el sentido
económico de que con ellas dan prueba las autoridades edilicias.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>XXX.&mdash;DEPORTES Y DIVERSIONES<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h3>

<p>&mdash;Supongo que las corridas de toros y las riñas de gallos están en
boga<a name="FNanchor_1_827" id="FNanchor_1_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_827" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> en toda la América española.</p>

<p>&mdash;Unas y otras se han prohibido en algunas repúblicas. Aunque las
corridas de toros alcanzaron mucha popularidad en Méjico, América
Central, Perú, Uruguay y otros países, no se han generalizado en el
continente. Las riñas o peleas de gallos se consideran también como un
espectáculo salvaje<a name="FNanchor_2_828" id="FNanchor_2_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_828" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> en los países más adelantados de la América
española.<a name="page_144" id="page_144"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;¿No tienen Uds. algún deporte típico, como lo es entre nosotros el
<i>baseball</i>?</p>

<p>&mdash;No; el que más se aproxima a la idea que Ud. expresa es el juego de
pelota, que en un tiempo fué más popular en Hispano-América que en
España misma, de donde sin embargo procede, después de haber sido
introducido por los vascos. Se construyeron excelentes frontones; pero
de algún tiempo a esta parte<a name="FNanchor_3_829" id="FNanchor_3_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_829" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> el <i>football</i> viene suplantando a la
pelota como deporte.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Según eso el <i>football</i> va en camino de llegar a ser popular?</p>

<p>&mdash;Lo es ya, y mucho, sobre todo en las repúblicas australes, en Centro
América y en las Antillas. Hay magníficas canchas en los alrededores de
las grandes ciudades, con muy buenas tribunas de mampostería desde las
cuales un público numeroso y entusiasta presencia las partidas. En la
ciudad de Buenos Aires hay cerca de mil asociaciones de jugadores de
<i>football</i>.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Se juega el <i>football</i> según las reglas que imperan en los Estados
Unidos?</p>

<p>&mdash;Eso sucede únicamente donde lo juegan norteamericanos. Pero tal cosa
es la excepción en las repúblicas del sur, en las cuales se le juega al
estilo de Inglaterra.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Es el <i>baseball</i> un juego popular?</p>

<p>&mdash;No se le conoce<a name="FNanchor_4_830" id="FNanchor_4_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_830" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> sino en las repúblicas próximas a los Estados
Unidos.</p>

<p>&mdash;Me sorprende Ud. ¿No hay norteamericanos en esos países?</p>

<p>&mdash;No tantos como ingleses o alemanes, para no mencionar a los españoles,
franceses e italianos. Por esta causa, en punto a<a name="FNanchor_5_831" id="FNanchor_5_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_831" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> deportes de origen
anglosajón, los ingleses predominan e imponen<a name="page_145" id="page_145"></a> sus usos. Estos juegan
mucho al <i>cricket</i> y han logrado introducir este juego, el <i>golf</i> y el
<i>polo</i> en la sociedad de los países donde viven. En el Brasil, Argentina
y Chile hay buenos campos de <i>golf</i>, y algunas estancias prestan
atención a la cría de jacas para el juego del <i>polo</i>, que ha hecho ya
muchos adeptos<a name="FNanchor_6_832" id="FNanchor_6_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_832" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> entre los criollos.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Son frecuentes las partidas de <i>football</i>, o los concursos atléticos
entre los estudiantes?</p>

<p>&mdash;Mucho; y se juegan no sólo entre las universidades de un país, o entre
las facultades o escuelas de una misma universidad, sino también entre
<i>teams</i> o equipos de distintos países. Ciertos torneos entre argentinos,
uruguayos, brasileños y chilenos han hecho época en los anales
deportivos.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Hay buenos campos para exhibiciones públicas de juegos atléticos?</p>

<p>&mdash;Las principales ciudades cuentan con ellos. Los sostienen asociaciones
especiales, las cuales reciben a veces subvenciones del estado,
donaciones de terreno, y otros elementos valiosos. Hay amplios
hipódromos municipales, o mantenidos por <i>clubs</i> hípicos o <i>jockey
clubs</i>, como asimismo se les llama. Estos hipódromos tienen pistas muy
bien cuidadas para carreras de caballos, de automóviles o de a pie,
aunque estas últimas se llevan a cabo en campos atléticos que mantienen
las sociedades deportivas y de gimnasia. Además de las carreras de
saltos con obstáculos, de velocidad o de resistencia, se corren en esas
pistas carreras de motocicletas y bicicletas, si bien para este objeto
especial algunas ciudades poseen velódromos.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Ha hecho progresos la aviación?</p>

<p>&mdash;Sí; particularmente en las cuatro repúblicas del sur, cuyas<a name="page_146" id="page_146"></a> capitales
mantienen espléndidos aeródromos. Dada la naturaleza de este deporte,
los que lo practican son más numerosos entre los militares que entre los
civiles; aunque en realidad los aviadores que actualmente poseen el
grado o cédula de pilotos en el ejército son aficionados que aprendieron
el deporte en las escuelas militares de aviación en esos países, y luego
fueron asimilados como clases u oficiales.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Y los deportes acuáticos?</p>

<p>&mdash;Se han generalizado en Chile, Brasil, Argentina, Uruguay y parte de
Centro América. En Chile, el centro de esos deportes es Valparaíso que
cuenta con muchos clubs de natación y de regatas, aunque los hay también
en Santiago, en Concepción y Lota. En el Brasil se han fundado <i>clubs</i>
remeros en Río de Janeiro y en Nictheroy, al otro lado de la bahía. En
cuanto a la Argentina, como las aguas del Plata contienen mucho fango,
el centro de las regatas está algo distante de Buenos Aires, en una
región sumamente pintoresca, cruzada por canales cuyas orillas están
sombreadas por sauces y otros árboles.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Cuáles son los deportes de la gente de los campos?</p>

<p>&mdash;Las carreras de caballos, las cuales han estimulado mucho la mejora
del ganado equino; la corrida de la sortija; el pato: juego en el cual
varios ginetes se persiguen para arrebatar de las manos de uno de ellos
un pato muerto o un objeto que represente este animal. La cinchada se
juega entre dos ginetes que atan los caballos entre sí con un lazo,
tirando en opuestas direcciones para hacer retroceder al contrario. El
juego de bolos, llamado boliche en Méjico, palitoque en Chile y bochas
en el Plata, es popular entre la gente de los campos en todas las
repúblicas latino-americanas. La <i>taba</i> es un juego de azar que consiste
en arrojar el hueso que lleva ese nombre de modo que caiga sobre
determinado lado.<a name="page_147" id="page_147"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;¿Han conservado esos pueblos días especiales de holgorio?</p>

<p>&mdash;El carnaval dura allí tres días; es decir el domingo, lunes y martes
que preceden al miércoles de Ceniza. El domingo que sigue se destina a
enterrar el carnaval como allí se dice. En Chile estos regocijos se
llaman <i>chalilones</i>. Para Corpus las poblaciones del Pacífico celebran
todavía aquellas procesiones que en la antigüedad tenían por objeto
propiciar antes de la cosecha la voluntad de los dioses. En estas
fiestas es notable el <i>catimbao</i> o máscara que sale de la procesión para
asustar a los tímidos.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Tienen bailes propios esas poblaciones?</p>

<p>&mdash;Sí, muchos. La <i>zamacueca</i> se baila en Chile, Perú y Colombia. En este
último país los nativos danzan el <i>bambuco</i>; en Méjico el <i>jarabe
tapatío</i>; en Cuba se bailan el <i>zapateo</i>, que es una derivación del
<i>zapateado</i> andaluz y el <i>danzón</i>, que es una contradanza transformada
en su música y en su cadencia, y la <i>calinda</i>; en el Río de la Plata los
bailes nativos típicos son el <i>pericón</i>, el <i>gato</i>, el <i>tango</i> y el
<i>cielito</i>, siendo este último un baile cantado.</p>

<p>&mdash;A propósito: ¿Cómo se expresan los sentimientos musicales de esos
pueblos?</p>

<p>&mdash;En el canto, cuya característica es la de ser de una sola voz. Además,
todos los cantos tienen expresión parecida: tanto la <i>milonga</i> y la
<i>vidalita</i> que, en la guitarra, cantan los paisanos en el Río de la
Plata, como el <i>yaraví</i> que, acompañándose de la <i>quena</i>, cantan los
indios y criollos serranos de Bolivia, Perú, Colombia y Chile,... todos
son cantares dulces y melancólicos; y aun cuando expresen el amor, están
impregnados de una profunda tristeza.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI"></a>XXXI.&mdash;SOMBRERERÍA CARA Y BARATA<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h3>

<p>&mdash;O mucho me engaño, o<a name="FNanchor_1_833" id="FNanchor_1_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_833" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> aquel sombrero está marcado con el precio de
mil dólares.</p>

<p>&mdash;No se engaña Ud. Algo carillo es el sombrero; pero sabrá Ud. que se
trata de un <i>montecristo</i>, el sombrero más famoso entre todos los
llamados «panamás».</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Hechos en Panamá?</p>

<p>&mdash;No; y por eso el nombre de panamá es impropio, tratándose de sombreros
que no proceden de allí, sino de tránsito. La gran mayoría de los
llamados «panamás» son hechos en el Ecuador y también en ciertas partes
de Colombia, denominándose <i>suazas</i>, los que de este último país
proceden; pero los principales centros de producción están en la primera
república nombrada, siendo los más famosos los de Montecristo y
Jipijapa. De allí procede el nombre jipijapa, o jipis, con que todos
ellos son conocidos en el mundo entero.</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Pero mil dólares!</p>

<p>&mdash;Sí, nada menos. Ese sombrero sin duda es fabricado con paja toquilla,
y ha de haber sido hecho de encargo.<a name="FNanchor_2_834" id="FNanchor_2_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_834" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Y sin embargo ¡pensar que las
mismas manos que han tejido ese finísimo jipijapa, quizás han hecho
sombreros que se venden a cuatro pesos la docena<a name="FNanchor_3_835" id="FNanchor_3_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_835" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>!</p>

<p>&mdash;Como aquéllos de clase ordinaria que veo allí.</p>

<p>&mdash;Esos no están hechos de paja, sino de palma. Se llaman <i>jíbaros</i> y los
llevan los labradores de Cuba y Puerto Rico. En<a name="page_149" id="page_149"></a> aquella percha hay
sombreros de fieltro que son típicos de la América española. Ese oscuro
es el callampa, muy usado en Chile; el que está al lado, de alas anchas,
es el chambergo, popular en el Río de la Plata; y aquel blanco de copa
baja es el sombrero jarano que a veces se ornamenta con cordones y
borlas.</p>

<p>&mdash;Más allá veo sombreros mejicanos.</p>

<p>&mdash;Son inconfundibles. En cambio, he aquí un sombrero cuyo nombre podría
desconcertar al más listo.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Cuál? ¿Ese de copa?</p>

<p>&mdash;Sí, pues cada república hispano-americana le ha dado un nombre
distinto: le llaman <i>sombrero de pelo</i> en la Argentina, <i>colero</i> en
Chile, <i>cubeta</i> en Méjico, <i>buche</i> en el Ecuador, y en otras partes
<i>chistera</i>, <i>galera</i>, <i>sorbete</i>, <i>bolero</i>, y qué sé yo cuántos<a name="FNanchor_4_836" id="FNanchor_4_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_836" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>

<p>&mdash;He oído decir a Ud. que en la América latina hay bancos de préstamos
para construcciones.</p>

<p>&mdash;Los hay, oficiales y privados. De la primera clase pueden<a name="page_150" id="page_150"></a> servir de
tipo los bancos hipotecarios, que hacen préstamos<a name="FNanchor_2_838" id="FNanchor_2_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_838" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> sobre bienes
raíces,<a name="FNanchor_3_839" id="FNanchor_3_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_839" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> sean éstos terrenos o edificios, entregando cédulas o bonos
en lugar de dinero en efectivo.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Qué se hace con esas cédulas?</p>

<p>&mdash;Se venden en la Bolsa,<a name="FNanchor_4_840" id="FNanchor_4_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_840" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> donde se cotizan como cualesquiera otros<a name="FNanchor_5_841" id="FNanchor_5_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_841" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
títulos.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Y qué relación hay entre el valor de la propiedad hipotecada y la
suma prestada por el banco?</p>

<p>&mdash;Esos bancos prestan más o menos hasta la mitad del valor<a name="page_151" id="page_151"></a> que arroja
la tasación y por un tiempo breve, que generalmente no pasa de cinco
años, lo cual quiere decir que la amortización que fijan es por lo menos
de veinte por ciento al año. Esos bancos prestan también sobre ciertos
cultivos, y suelen adelantar dinero con hipoteca a industriales para el
fomento de sus negocios.</p>

<p>&mdash;Dice Ud. que estos bancos oficiales prestan al público para la
construcción de casas de familia. ¿A qué interés se hacen esas
operaciones, y con qué amortización?</p>

<p>&mdash;Al seis por ciento de interés anual y tres de amortización.</p>

<p>&mdash;He oído decir que en algunos países latino-americanos el estado
administra un banco oficial.</p>

<p>&mdash;Es verdad. Los bancos del estado se llaman bancos nacionales o
federales, y a veces tienen sucursales en las ciudades y pueblos más
importantes del país.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Emiten billetes<a name="FNanchor_6_842" id="FNanchor_6_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_842" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> esos bancos?</p>

<p>&mdash;En algunos países son ellos los únicos que tienen ese privilegio. En
otros, cualquier banco está autorizado para emitir billetes siempre que
garantice sus emisiones, depositando oro, bonos del tesoro u otros
títulos en la Tesorería nacional. A este propósito es sorprendente la
actividad desarrollada por las principales naciones latino-americanas en
sus esfuerzos por redimir el papel moneda y establecer el patrón de oro.
Algunas han dictado leyes de conversión señalando un plazo para que los
bancos retiren sus emisiones y asegurando en el futuro emisiones
garantizadas por los bancos de estado y las cajas de conversión o de
emisión.<a name="page_152" id="page_152"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;¿Qué instituciones son esas cajas de conversión?</p>

<p>&mdash;Oficinas de cambio destinadas a dar ejecución a las leyes de
conversión, dando oro al que trae papel y papel al que trae oro, en
ambos casos al tipo fijado por la ley. La Argentina, el Brasil y Chile
han dado estabilidad a la moneda por ese medio, habiendo hecho cesar el
agio del oro en la Bolsa. La Argentina, que inició el sistema en la
América latina, cuenta ya con un fondo de conversión, de cientos de
millones de pesos oro, los cuales sirven de garantía metálica al papel
moneda en circulación. La proporción entre ese <i>encaje</i> y la moneda
circulante es en ese país más elevada que en ningún otro del mundo.</p>

<p>&mdash;Volviendo a<a name="FNanchor_7_843" id="FNanchor_7_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_843" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> los bancos de Estado, ¿qué clase de operaciones
realizan?</p>

<p>&mdash;Las operaciones propias de<a name="FNanchor_8_844" id="FNanchor_8_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_844" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> una institución oficial financiera:
intervienen en todo pago en que es parte el gobierno federal, y guardan
en depósito los dineros de todas las reparticiones públicas dependientes
de ese gobierno.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Hacen además esos bancos las operaciones mercantiles usuales de
depósito, cambio, cheques, cartas de crédito, descuentos de pagarés y
operaciones de giros y letras de cambio?</p>

<p>&mdash;Como otro banco cualquiera con la ventaja de que<a name="FNanchor_9_845" id="FNanchor_9_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_845" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> sus operaciones
están garantizadas por la nación misma.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Cuánto se paga en las plazas de la América latina sobre los
depósitos?</p>

<p>&mdash;Según la forma en que se hagan. Si el depósito es a plazo fijo,<a name="FNanchor_10_846" id="FNanchor_10_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_846" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> se
le acuerda el interés más alto, cuyo tipo depende del<a name="page_153" id="page_153"></a> tiempo convenido.
En caja de ahorros, a sesenta días se paga cuatro por ciento al año. En
cuenta corriente no se paga nada, o un interés muy bajo.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Abren los bancos créditos para girar al descubierto?</p>

<p>&mdash;Algunas veces, a firmas de reconocida solvencia, pero entonces la
cancelación<a name="FNanchor_11_847" id="FNanchor_11_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_847" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> de las cuentas se hace al fin de cada trimestre.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿A qué interés?</p>

<p>&mdash;Al ocho por ciento, por lo general.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Se descuentan documentos referentes a ventas de mercaderías?</p>

<p>&mdash;Corrientemente. Un documento relativo a una venta de géneros, que
lleve las firmas del aceptante o de su inmediato deudor y el endoso de
la persona que lo negocie, se considera como un pagaré y se descuenta a
un plazo variable, cuyo límite es seis meses.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Cómo se efectúan las transacciones en los negocios de exportación?</p>

<p>&mdash;En esos casos los banqueros y casas exportadoras giran sus letras
sobre plazas del exterior y las ofrecen a los bancos por conducto de los
corredores.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿A qué clase de géneros se refieren esas operaciones?</p>

<p>&mdash;A embarques de productos, como cereales, lanas y otros frutos.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Qué garantía exigen los bancos en este caso?</p>

<p>&mdash;Los documentos deben ir acompañados de las facturas y conocimientos de
embarque. Es evidente que a los bancos les conviene realizar esas
operaciones, porque de ese modo<a name="page_154" id="page_154"></a> colocan en el exterior los fondos que
necesitan para las operaciones de cambio.</p>

<p>&mdash;Infórmeme Ud. ahora acerca de cual es el mecanismo de las operaciones
cuando se trata de la importación en esos países de artículos europeos.
Se ha hablado tanto de la resistencia que ponen los exportadores
norteamericanos para imitar los procedimientos comerciales europeos, que
me interesa sobremanera saber en qué consisten estos últimos.</p>

<p>&mdash;En toda la América latina, el método seguido en sus ventas por los
agentes de firmas europeas es el que sigue: El precio se entiende libre
de gastos a bordo (f.o.b.) en el puerto de origen. El agente europeo,
después de haber reunido y envasado sus respectivas compras, las entrega
abordo del vapor, habiendo pedido con anticipación el espacio necesario;
entonces agrega a la factura comercial el importe del flete a destino
(el cual se paga por anticipado), el de aseguro marítimo y derechos
consulares, y luego esta factura, acompañada de la consular y el
original del conocimiento de embarque, juntamente con una letra de
cambio a noventa días en contra del comprador, se envía directamente al
consignatario por el mismo vapor que lleva las mercancías. El vendedor
europeo descuenta la letra en su banco, pagando ocho meses de interés
por el descuento.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Por qué ocho meses?</p>

<p>&mdash;Porque ese es el tiempo que dura la transacción. El negociante
latino-americano acepta el documento a su recibo, un mes después que el
vendedor lo ha cobrado, y a su vencimiento, es decir, después de tres
meses, paga con otra letra a noventa días vista sobre un banco de
Europa. Los noventa días de la primera letra, el mes para que el
comprador reciba el documento, el otro mes para que la letra enviada por
el comprador llegue a Europa, y los tres meses para su maduración, hacen
los ocho meses.<a name="page_155" id="page_155"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;Según ese ejemplo, veo que los efectos del crédito a largos plazos que
dan al exportador europeo una gran ventaja sobre nosotros, los de los
Estados Unidos, no recaen sobre el exportador sino sobre el banco.</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Bravo! Ha puesto Ud. el dedo en la llaga.<a name="FNanchor_12_848" id="FNanchor_12_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_848" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Eso es lo que no
comprenden los que hasta hace poco han venido censurando a los
exportadores norteamericanos el no conceder créditos a largos plazos
como lo hacen los europeos. Ud. lo ha dicho muy bien: En Europa los
efectos de la operación a descubierto no recaen sobre el comerciante
vendedor. Este es responsable sólo en segundo término. En los Estados
Unidos la organización comercial y bancaria no permite (o más
exactamente, no permitía, mientras no se promulgó la ley de reserva
federal) imitar los procedimientos europeos descriptos. El exportador
que en los Estados Unidos hubiera deseado abrir crédito a los
importadores latino-americanos, habría carecido de un mecanismo bancario
que le permitiera negociar sus créditos. No pudiendo reembolsar el
importe de sus ventas a la presentación de los documentos de aceptación
de la mercadería, como lo hace el europeo con los suyos, habría debido
aumentar su capital para llenar el vacío causado por las ventas a plazo.
Por lo tanto, para realizar el mismo volumen de negocios que un
fabricante europeo, el norteamericano necesitaría un capital mayor. Sus
utilidades serían relativamente menores y por lo tanto la competencia
habría sido ruinosa para él.</p>

<p>&mdash;Ya veo que la posibilidad de conceder créditos requiere una
organización bancaria especial que permita al exportador negociar sus
créditos.</p>

<p>&mdash;De esa organización han gozado durante mucho tiempo<a name="page_156" id="page_156"></a> los exportadores
europeos. Han podido transferir directamente a sus propios bancos las
deudas de los comerciantes de Río de Janeiro o Buenos Aires, por medio
de las letras de aceptación remitidas por estos últimos.</p>

<p>&mdash;Lo veo bien claro. Al recibir sus documentos, el exportador europeo
cobra su dinero en moneda contante y sonante, cosa que no podía hacer el
norteamericano.</p>

<p>&mdash;Y precisamente los bancos más fuertes de Europa se han organizado con
el objeto de operar sobre tales créditos. Y, correlativamente, una gran
parte de los bancos de las repúblicas americanas no son sino sucursales
de las instituciones europeas.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿La ley de reserva federal no ha modificado ese estado de cosas?</p>

<p>&mdash;Sí, radicalmente; pues ella permite descontar los avisos de
aceptación.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿De modo que hoy nada se opone a la práctica en los Estados Unidos de
los métodos europeos en las transacciones bancarias con la América
latina?</p>

<p>&mdash;Nada, como no sea<a name="FNanchor_13_849" id="FNanchor_13_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_849" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> la resistencia que ofrece el comercio a
generalizar un procedimiento con el cual los hombres de negocios de este
país no están suficientemente familiarizados todavía.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII"></a>XXXIII.&mdash;ENTRANDO AL MERCADO LATINO-AMERICANO<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h3>

<p>&mdash;Entusiasmado por la pintura que hace Ud. de la América latina, deseo
tentar mi suerte en esos nuevos mercados. Pero ignoro, me avergüenzo de
decirlo, los detalles más elementales de tal tentativa; y en verdad no
sabría ni siquiera cómo empezar mi nueva empresa.</p>

<p>&mdash;En cuanto a eso, todo depende del vuelo que Ud. piense dar a los
negocios. No sería malo<a name="FNanchor_1_850" id="FNanchor_1_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_850" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> que Ud. hiciera un primer ensayo por medio de
alguna de las casas comisionistas de exportación establecidas en este
país.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Qué clase de negocios hacen esas casas?</p>

<p>&mdash;Algunas sirven de agentes a ciertas empresas importadoras de la
América latina, realizando los pedidos y cobrando una comisión por este
servicio. Otras son establecimientos mercantiles extensamente
ramificados, con sucursales en los principales países del mundo. Por
último, algunas de esas casas comisionistas son representantes
exclusivos de fuertes firmas importadoras establecidas en el extranjero.</p>

<p>&mdash;Dice Ud. bien:<a name="FNanchor_2_851" id="FNanchor_2_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_851" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> este procedimiento sería muy conveniente, sobre todo
al principio, pues me evitaría el desagrado de tratar directamente con
personas que operan en mercados que no conozco.</p>

<p>&mdash;Ciertamente. Se desentendería Ud. de<a name="FNanchor_3_852" id="FNanchor_3_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_852" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> créditos, de los<a name="page_158" id="page_158"></a> detalles y
minuciosidades de la remisión, de atender reclamos, etc., y además
recibiría su dinero inmediatamente.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Qué me cuenta Ud.?<a name="FNanchor_4_853" id="FNanchor_4_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_853" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> ¿Toman sobre sí<a name="FNanchor_5_854" id="FNanchor_5_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_854" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> esas casas la
responsabilidad exclusiva de cobrar el importe de las ventas?</p>

<p>&mdash;Sí tal. Para eso se han informado de antemano acerca de la solvencia,
o como también se dice, la responsabilidad o el crédito de sus
corresponsales. Como lo ve Ud., este procedimiento es el más expeditivo
para quien, como Ud.,<a name="FNanchor_6_855" id="FNanchor_6_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_855" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> considera que sus negocios de exportación son
asunto incidental<a name="FNanchor_7_856" id="FNanchor_7_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_856" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>; pero si Ud. desease fundar desde luego<a name="FNanchor_8_857" id="FNanchor_8_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_857" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> un
negocio importante, el mejor medio sería ponerse en relaciones directas
con el mercado.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Y para ello ...?</p>

<p>&mdash;El procedimiento más recomendable sería, a mi juicio, establecer una
sucursal en cada centro comercial importante, a cuyo frente pondría Ud.
un gerente, auxiliado por un cuerpo de empleados, alquilando un local
que pudiera servir de almacén para el depósito de las mercancías.</p>

<p>&mdash;Las mías son máquinas, como Ud. sabe.</p>

<p>&mdash;En ese caso sería indispensable una buena reserva de piezas de
repuesto. Su representante podría ir observando las condiciones del
mercado, estudiando las fuentes de la concurrencia, y lo que es más
importante, poniéndose en relaciones con quienes pudieran ser
compradores.</p>

<p>&mdash;Un inconveniente veo en el procedimiento, y es el gasto considerable
que implica.<a name="page_159" id="page_159"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;Sin duda hay que gastar mucho en establecer y mantener un plantel
semejante; por eso, sólo pueden costear esta representación las empresas
más poderosas, quienes, precisamente debido a ello, han llevado a cabo
negocios importantes monopolizando a veces ciertas actividades
comerciales.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Qué tal sería<a name="FNanchor_9_858" id="FNanchor_9_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_858" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> mandar a esos países un agente viajero?</p>

<p>&mdash;Es un procedimiento muy en boga; pero en ese caso deberá Ud. elegir
una persona que hable el castellano, y sobre todo que sea de una cultura
y experiencia algo mayor de la que usualmente se requiere para tales
trabajos en los Estados Unidos. Ya sabe Ud. lo que nos recomiendan los
que entienden de estas cosas<a name="FNanchor_10_859" id="FNanchor_10_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_859" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>: «¡guiaos<a name="FNanchor_11_860" id="FNanchor_11_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_860" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> por una política
ilustrada, mandad comerciantes, no buhoneros y baratilleros!» En otras
palabras, Ud. deberá enviar un agente que sea capaz de apreciar otros
elementos fuera de los que se refieren a la utilidad que dejan las
ventas. Su representante debe ser persona educada, capaz de<a name="FNanchor_12_861" id="FNanchor_12_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_861" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
comportarse como caballero; deberá llevar cartas de presentación que le
abran las puertas de los negociantes más conocidos, de los clubs y
bancos, de las cámaras de comercio y otras organizaciones e
instituciones mercantiles.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿No es posible utilizar como agentes a personas o firmas ya
establecidas?</p>

<p>&mdash;Sin duda; pero, naturalmente, tendrá Ud. que cuidar, ante todo, de que
esos representantes no estén interesados en la venta de productos
propios similares a los suyos.</p>

<p>&mdash;Me imagino que las casas serias no aceptarán una representación<a name="page_160" id="page_160"></a> a
menos que se les dé agencia exclusiva en toda la América latina.</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Oh, no! La representación debe darse por países, aunque es cierto que
en algunos casos es posible, y hasta conveniente, incluir varias
pequeñas repúblicas vecinas en un solo territorio; como, por ejemplo,
toda la América Central, o bien, regiones limítrofes tales como
Argentina, Paraguay y Uruguay. En algunos países, especialmente en
aquéllos que no cuentan con vías de fácil comunicación, como en Colombia
y Venezuela, donde sería difícil y caro remitir las mercaderías de un
punto a otro muy distante, es necesario a veces dividir la
representación o hacer de modo que<a name="FNanchor_13_862" id="FNanchor_13_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_862" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> los artículos sean remitidos
directamente desde aquí a los clientes que residen en los distritos más
distantes.</p>

<p>&mdash;Y si remitiera un catálogo a los comerciantes de la América latina a
quienes mis artículos pudieran interesar, ¿no cree Ud. que recibiría
pedidos de allá? Ninguno de los cónsules de esos países se negaría, me
imagino, a remitirme una nómina de los comerciantes en mi ramo ....</p>

<p>&mdash;No le aconsejo a Ud. ese procedimiento. Desde luego tendría Ud. que
gastar en la traducción al castellano de sus catálogos, pues no hay que
pensar en remitirlos en inglés. Pero aun así, dudo que los resultados
correspondieran al esfuerzo. Deseche Ud. la esperanza de capturar
mercados con tan sencillos procedimientos. Antes que eso, le aconsejaría
constituir aquí una asociación entre fabricantes de artículos semejantes
a los suyos, y reducir de ese modo los gastos de una representación en
el exterior. Me consta que algunos fabricantes mantienen<a name="page_161" id="page_161"></a> con éxito
agencias de esta clase, de las cuales reciben informaciones referentes a
las condiciones del mercado, al par que mantienen<a name="FNanchor_14_863" id="FNanchor_14_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_863" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> con el público un
contacto personal, que es la mejor manera de interesar a los presuntos
compradores.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV"></a>XXXIV.&mdash;LAS IMPORTACIONES DE NORTE AMERICA<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h3>

<p>&mdash;¿Cuáles son las mercaderías, de los Estados Unidos que tienen fácil
salida<a name="FNanchor_1_864" id="FNanchor_1_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_864" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> en las plazas de la América latina?</p>

<p>&mdash;Su pregunta no puede contestarse en términos generales. Desde luego la
demanda de ciertos artículos está impuesta por la geografía, el clima y
las condiciones industriales de cada país. En la zona tórrida, no
venderá Ud. vestidos de abrigo ni patines para el hielo. En ciertas
ciudades argentinas y uruguayas donde la madera escasea, sería absurdo
ofrecer en venta estufas que requieren leña como combustible; y en el
norte de Chile, donde no llueve nunca, estarían de más los capotes
impermeables.</p>

<p>&mdash;Esas son verdades de «Pero Grullo».<a name="FNanchor_2_865" id="FNanchor_2_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_865" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Mi pregunta tenía por objeto
averiguar cómo influye la concurrencia de artículos europeos en la
demanda por los productos similares norteamericanos.<a name="page_162" id="page_162"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;A ese respecto debe decirse que algunos géneros norteamericanos deben
sufrir esa concurrencia con más éxito que otros.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Cuáles son las mercaderías que se imponen en el mercado<a name="FNanchor_3_866" id="FNanchor_3_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_866" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>?</p>

<p>&mdash;Los artículos de metal,&mdash;es decir, los de aluminio, hierro, acero,
cobre y latón, así como las aleaciones de esos metales.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Las mercaderías de madera no se hallan en este caso?</p>

<p>&mdash;Sí, por cierto; desde el producto bruto hasta el mueble más fino. Y
otro tanto ocurre con los artículos de cuero, caucho y goma vulcanizada.</p>

<p>&mdash;Hasta aquí<a name="FNanchor_4_867" id="FNanchor_4_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_867" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> he comprendido perfectamente. Ahora dígame Ud. ¿cuáles
son las manufacturas que no compiten con éxito con las europeas?</p>

<p>&mdash;En esta clase entran los textiles, particularmente los tejidos de
algodón, hilo y lana; las lozas, porcelanas y artículos de vidrio y
cristal; las preparaciones de perfumería, los vinos, licores y otras
bebidas.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿De modo que sería excusado<a name="FNanchor_5_868" id="FNanchor_5_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_868" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> pretender introducir en la América
latina las mercaderías que Ud. acaba de mencionar?</p>

<p>&mdash;No he dicho tanto.<a name="FNanchor_6_869" id="FNanchor_6_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_869" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Aquí se presenta otro aspecto de la cuestión. La
concurrencia europea no es igualmente intensa en toda la América latina.
Hay una zona, que comprende Méjico, América Central y las Antillas,
donde los Estados Unidos llevan a Europa la ventaja de la proximidad y
de una relación comercial más estrecha. Se puede decir que allí los
Estados Unidos dominan en el comercio, como lo prueba el hecho de que
las importaciones de este país son cuatro veces mayores que las de la
Gran Bretaña.<a name="page_163" id="page_163"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;¿Quiere Ud. decir con eso que en la zona del Caribe nuestras
mercancías tienen mayor salida que las similares europeas?</p>

<p>&mdash;Así es. En cuanto al resto de la América latina, esto es, los países
de Sud América, las relaciones comerciales que éstos mantienen con
Europa son más íntimas y fáciles, y la concurrencia es desfavorable a
Uds. en cuanto a artículos de igual calidad y costo de producción. Como
resultado de esta diferencia, la Europa domina en esa zona, con una
importación muchísimo mayor que la de Estados Unidos. Allí sólo pueden
imponerse las mercaderías realmente superiores,&mdash;entre ellas las ya
mencionadas de metal, madera, cuero y caucho, en que los Estados Unidos
se distinguen.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV"></a>XXXV.&mdash;NACIONALIDAD<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h3>

<p>&mdash;¿Cómo imponen la nacionalidad las repúblicas de la América latina?</p>

<p>&mdash;En la mayor parte de esas repúblicas se consideran naturales todos los
nacidos en ellas.<a name="FNanchor_1_870" id="FNanchor_1_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_870" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Algunas excluyen de esta condición a los hijos de
extranjeros, siempre que<a name="FNanchor_2_871" id="FNanchor_2_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_871" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> el hijo no opte por la nacionalidad de
nacimiento al llegar a su mayoría de edad.<a name="FNanchor_3_872" id="FNanchor_3_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_872" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> En otras, las
constituciones acuerdan a los hijos la nacionalidad de sus padres sólo
en caso que aquéllos expresamente lo soliciten dentro de un tiempo breve
después de alcanzada la mayoría de edad.<a name="page_164" id="page_164"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;¿Conserva el que nace en el extranjero, de padres latino-americanos la
nacionalidad de sus progenitores?</p>

<p>&mdash;Fuera de Méjico y alguna otra república cuyas constituciones declaran
nacionales a todos los hijos de padres nativos, sin excepción,
incluyendo así, por lo tanto, a todos los nacidos en el extranjero, los
demás países latino-americanos sólo adoptan este principio cuando el así
nacido<a name="FNanchor_4_873" id="FNanchor_4_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_873" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> se domicilia en el país.</p>

<p>&mdash;Y en ese caso, ¿deben ambos padres ser nativos de la república de que
se trate?</p>

<p>&mdash;Algunas constituciones exigen que ambos padres lo sean; otras
requieren esta condición sólo del padre; algunas&mdash;las menos&mdash;del padre o
la madre.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Se estimula la naturalización de los extranjeros?</p>

<p>&mdash;Sí, por cierto; pero la legislación al caso no es uniforme. Algunos
países establecen que todo extranjero que ejerce algún oficio o
profesión, o que posee propiedad raíz o capital en giro, es considerado
ciudadano, a menos que aquél manifieste su propósito de conservar su
nacionalidad original. En la mayoría de los países la ciudadanía debe
solicitarse, y el tiempo de residencia necesaria para ello varía desde
un año en Chile hasta diez en Panamá.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿No puede abreviarse ese tiempo?</p>

<p>&mdash;Sí; en caso de que el extranjero en cuestión sea propietario, o tenga
familia, y sobre todo si es casado con una natural del país. Algunas
repúblicas hispanoamericanas facilitan la naturalización a los hijos de
las otras naciones hermanas. La mayoría de las repúblicas de Centro
América consideran ciudadanos de las mismas a todos los residentes que,
nacidos en otra nación centroamericana, no expresen el deseo de
conservar su nacionalidad.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI"></a>XXXVI.&mdash;EDUCACIÓN<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h3>

<p>&mdash;¿A qué edad comienza la educación de los niños en la América latina?</p>

<p>&mdash;Cada uno de esos países tiene su legislación propia, y ésta admite
diferencias aún dentro de una misma nación; pero puede decirse que en
general los niños ingresan a la escuela primaria a los seis años de
edad.<a name="FNanchor_1_874" id="FNanchor_1_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_874" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> En los países que han incorporado a sus instituciones de
enseñanza los jardines de infantes, o sea escuelas maternales o
<i>kindergartens</i> como también se los llama, el niño empieza su educación
a una edad más temprana.<a name="FNanchor_2_875" id="FNanchor_2_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_875" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>&mdash;Hablaba Ud. hace un momento de diferencias en la legislación escolar
dentro de cada país: ¿no está centralizada en cada una la dirección de
la educación?</p>

<p>&mdash;Es cierto que casi todas las naciones hispano-americanas han creado en
la administración federal un Ministerio encargado de dirigir la
instrucción pública; pero por lo común, ese departamento gubernamental
se encarga sólo de administrar la educación superior, la secundaria, la
normal y la especial. Tocante al<a name="FNanchor_3_876" id="FNanchor_3_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_876" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> gobierno de la enseñanza primaria,
la tendencia de la legislación es asegurar a su respecto la autonomía de
los estados, provincias o departamentos, que son los nombres de las
divisiones políticas correspondientes a las que, en Estados Unidos, se
llaman estados. En cada una de esas divisiones las autoridades dirigen
los asuntos relativos a la enseñanza primaria con entera independencia y
aún con rentas propias; en otros países la autonomía es menos completa,
y los consejos locales administran<a name="page_166" id="page_166"></a> los fondos votados por el gobierno
federal. Por último, no es raro el caso en que<a name="FNanchor_4_877" id="FNanchor_4_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_877" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> los dineros destinados
a la educación proceden de ambas fuentes.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Es gratuita la enseñanza elemental?</p>

<p>&mdash;Casi en todas partes; pero aun donde la gratuidad es un principio
proclamado, no todos los niños reciben gratuitamente los libros y otros
útiles escolares. Algunos países todavía imponen a los educandos un
derecho pecuniario que se paga al recibir la matrícula. Este impuesto es
módico, sin embargo, y de él están exentos los que no pueden
satisfacerlo.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Es también obligatoria la enseñanza primaria?</p>

<p>&mdash;La ley así lo establece en la gran mayoría de las repúblicas de que
tratamos; pero son tantos los inconvenientes con que se tropieza para
dar instrucción a todos los niños en edad escolar,<a name="FNanchor_5_878" id="FNanchor_5_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_878" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> que las
contravenciones a la ley quedan impunes.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Cuáles son los inconvenientes a que Ud. se refiere?</p>

<p>&mdash;Uno de los mayores obstáculos a la difusión de la enseñanza es la
vasta extensión de casi todos esos países, en los cuales la población se
halla diseminada aquí y allá.<a name="FNanchor_6_879" id="FNanchor_6_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_879" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Como puede esperarse,<a name="FNanchor_7_880" id="FNanchor_7_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_880" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> los centros
urbanos dan las cifras más altas de inscripción y asistencia escolares.</p>

<p>&mdash;Nuestras equivocadas ideas acerca de la América latina nos hacen
pensar involuntariamente en que todas esas repúblicas siguen los mismos
planes y administran sus escuelas del mismo modo.<a name="page_167" id="page_167"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;Ya ve Ud. que no es así. Hablando de planes,<a name="FNanchor_8_881" id="FNanchor_8_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_881" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> y sin salir por ahora
de la enseñanza primaria, le diré a Ud. que ésta dura cuatro años en
algunos países y en otros más, aunque seis puede considerarse el
promedio general. Unos países han establecido la escuela intermedia,
entre la primaria y la secundaria; en los otros los cursos del
bachillerato empalman con los de la escuela elemental sin transición
alguna.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Se exige que los niños pronuncien el idioma materno como lo hacen los
españoles?</p>

<p>&mdash;Sólo por excepción, especialmente cuando en las clases de lenguaje los
alumnos deben distinguir ciertas letras por su sonido; pero fuera de
estos casos, no se insiste en la pronunciación peninsular.<a name="FNanchor_9_882" id="FNanchor_9_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_882" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Esto no
obstante, en el estudio del idioma se ponen ante el alumno los autores
más castizos, tanto nacionales como de España. Se hace esfuerzos por
conservar las formas puras y el significado propio de las palabras; pero
cuando las voces nuevas o alteradas en su acepción responden a
diferencias en el ambiente y las costumbres, se muestra el mismo celo
por consagrar su significado y arraigarlas en el habla popular.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Cuentan todas las escuelas primarias con maestros diplomados?<a name="page_168" id="page_168"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;Tampoco es ello posible excepto en los países más ricos y adelantados,
y eso sólo en ciertas zonas. En todas partes se nota<a name="FNanchor_10_883" id="FNanchor_10_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_883" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> la necesidad de
aumentar el número de las escuelas normales. Muchos países remedian en
parte<a name="FNanchor_11_884" id="FNanchor_11_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_884" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> esta deficiencia, dando clases de pedagogía y ciencias afines
en los institutos secundarios.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Qué modelos siguen los educadores latino-americanos en la
organización de la enseñanza?</p>

<p>&mdash;En la escuela primaria las ideas pedagógicas de los Estados Unidos se
han impuesto; pero en la enseñanza secundaria predominan los sistemas
franceses y alemanes.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Cuál es la razón de esa diferencia?</p>

<p>&mdash;Los colegios o liceos de enseñanza secundaria existían como anexos de
las universidades antes que se organizara la enseñanza primaria. Cuando
esto último ocurrió, los institutos secundarios no ligaron su suerte a
la de la escuela primaria, ni progresaron al paso de ella como ocurrió
en los Estados Unidos, sino que conservaron sus viejas relaciones con la
Universidad, de la cual muchos son anexos hoy día.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Ocurre eso en todos los países latinoamericanos?</p>

<p>&mdash;Sí; sobre todo en aquéllos donde las viejas universidades han impuesto
una dirección a la educación. Algunos países, y ciertas regiones dentro
de un país, están más libres que otros de esa tradición y, por lo tanto,
han comenzado a organizar la enseñanza secundaria como continuación de
la primaria, con el propósito de que la mayor parte del pueblo pueda
terminar en ella su educación después de haber adquirido conocimientos
de valor práctico para la vida.<a name="page_169" id="page_169"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;A propósito de esos anhelos, ¿ha progresado algo la enseñanza
industrial en la América latina?</p>

<p>&mdash;En algunos países esa enseñanza ha sufrido una evolución
significativa. Por muchos años sus limitadas actividades tenían por
órganos humildes escuelas pobremente equipadas y dirigidas por
religiosos, a las que asistían niños huérfanos, abandonados o
precozmente delincuentes. Pero hoy día la enseñanza industrial se va
dignificando en algunos países, en donde pueden verse institutos tan
bien equipados y dirigidos como las buenas <i>manual training high
schools</i> de los Estados Unidos. Las escuelas de comercio se extienden
igualmente, así las de varones como las para mujeres.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Se da a la mujer una enseñanza profesional fuera de la que se exige
para ejercer el magisterio?</p>

<p>&mdash;Sí, señor; pues la enseñanza industrial para la mujer ha pasado de la
etapa filantrópica a la económica, aunque sólo en algunos centros, que
son contados<a name="FNanchor_12_885" id="FNanchor_12_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_885" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> todavía. En ellos no sólo se ha franqueado ante la
mujer las puertas de la universidad sino&mdash;lo que es más importante
todavía&mdash;las de las escuelas profesionales, donde ella adquiere las
artes manuales indispensables para su independencia económica. Ya
funcionan en la América latina escuelas agrícolas para mujeres donde se
les inculca los conocimientos que tienen relación con la granja y el
hogar.</p>

<p>&mdash;Según eso, las escuelas agrícolas para varones deben de hallarse en un
estado floreciente.</p>

<p>&mdash;Sí; sobre todo en la Argentina, Brasil y Chile. Además de los
institutos para la enseñanza de la agricultura en general, empiezan allí
a fundarse las escuelas regionales; es decir, las escuelas destinadas al
estudio científico y la explotación económica<a name="page_170" id="page_170"></a> de los productos de la
región en que se hallan. Así encuentra Ud. escuelas de viti-vinicultura,
de sacaritecnia para el estudio del azúcar, de praticultura para el
estudio de los prados y la alimentación del ganado, las de lechería, de
fruticultura, escuelas forestales, de productos industriales tropicales,
etc.</p>

<p>&mdash;He oído decir que la enseñanza militar y la naval están bien
organizadas en Argentina y Chile.</p>

<p>&mdash;También el Brasil presta atención creciente a esta rama de la
educación técnica. Además de la escuela militar, hay en esos países
escuelas superiores de guerra, de caballería, de tiro, de clases o sea
de cabos y sargentos, de aprendices armeros, y de aviación. En el ramo
de la marina, aparte de las escuelas navales que preparan los oficiales
de las respectivas escuadras, las hay de aplicación para los mismos, así
como para pilotos, aprendices artilleros, torpedistas, mecánicos,
marineros, grumetes y foguistas.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Tienen esos países el servicio militar obligatorio?</p>

<p>&mdash;Sí; y hace Ud. bien en<a name="FNanchor_13_886" id="FNanchor_13_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_886" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> mencionar ese punto al tratar de la
educación, pues la <i>conscripción</i> militar es una verdadera escuela en la
que los jóvenes de veinte años completan su educación, reciben nociones
de agricultura y se ejercitan en ciertas prácticas industriales.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Son las universidades<a name="FNanchor_14_887" id="FNanchor_14_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_887" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> parecidas a las nuestras?<a name="page_171" id="page_171"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;Parécense más bien a las viejas universidades de las naciones
católicas europeas, cuyo espíritu han conservado en parte aunque una vez
que pasaron a depender del Estado se impuso en ellas, como consecuencia,
la enseñanza laica. Hay, sin embargo, algunas universidades católicas y
otras que, aunque oficiales, enseñan teología y derecho canónico.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Es cierto que algunas universidades hispanoamericanas se fundaron
antes que las nuestras?</p>

<p>&mdash;No sólo eso, sino que las Universidades de San Marcos en Lima, la de
Méjico, la de Bogotá en Colombia y la de Córdoba en la Argentina
funcionaban ya cuando los primeros peregrinos llegaron a Plymouth.</p>

<p>&mdash;Es sorprendente. ¿Todos los países latinoamericanos tienen
universidades?</p>

<p>&mdash;Con excepción de dos o tres,&mdash;donde, sin embargo, funciona alguna
escuela profesional superior cuyos estudios son de carácter
universitario&mdash;todas las repúblicas americanas tienen una o varias
universidades nacionales, esto es, sostenidas con los fondos del
gobierno federal y administradas por autoridades nombradas por él. Esta
circunstancia asegura la validez del diploma en todo el territorio de la
república, y, en ciertos casos, como ocurre en Guatemala, los títulos
son aceptados en otras repúblicas. Pero esto es caso excepcional.<a name="page_172" id="page_172"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;¿Se aceptan en las repúblicas latinoamericanas los títulos
profesionales de las universidades norteamericanas?</p>

<p>&mdash;No; los que de ellas egresan deben dar un examen de reválida ante la
universidad cuyos títulos desean obtener.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Cuáles facultades son más concurridas?</p>

<p>&mdash;Las de jurisprudencia, de ciencias políticas, de filosofía y letras,
de artes liberales y ciencias. Además hay facultades de medicina,
farmacia, odontología, de ingeniería, de agricultura y veterinaria, etc.
Sin embargo, una evolución significativa ha tenido lugar en la
Argentina, donde la Facultad de Medicina es la más frecuentada de las
que componen la Universidad de Buenos Aires, que es a su vez la más
grande de la América latina.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Cuántos alumnos tiene esa Universidad?</p>

<p>&mdash;Alrededor de ocho mil.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿A qué nacionalidad pertenecen por lo general los profesionales?</p>

<p>&mdash;Casi todos los que reciben un título en las Universidades de la
América latina son hijos del país. El ser<a name="FNanchor_15_888" id="FNanchor_15_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_888" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> doctor es una aspiración
general en ellos; con que<a name="FNanchor_16_889" id="FNanchor_16_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_889" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> quien no es<a name="FNanchor_17_890" id="FNanchor_17_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_890" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> médico,<a name="FNanchor_18_891" id="FNanchor_18_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_891" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> abogado<a name="FNanchor_19_892" id="FNanchor_19_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_892" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> o

embargo, la copiosa emigración al Plata ha llevado a las universidades
argentinas muchos extranjeros, particularmente italianos y judíos
rusos.<a name="page_173" id="page_173"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;Ha nombrado Ud. los abogados. ¿Se desarrollan los procesos jurídicos
en la misma forma que en los Estados Unidos?</p>

<p>&mdash;Existen diferencias substanciales. Cada juez está auxiliado por
escribanos o notarios, en cuyas oficinas, llamadas notarías, o
escribanías, se presentan las demandas que constituyen la primera pieza
de autos. A ésta se van agregando y cosiendo todas las subsiguientes,
formando así lo que se llama<a name="FNanchor_28_901" id="FNanchor_28_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_901" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> un expediente. A continuación de cada
pieza, el escribano asienta todas las providencias, decretos,
interrogatorios, careos, etc., al pie de los cuales el juez pone su
«visto bueno» (Vº Bº).</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Quién hace la notificación a las partes?</p>

<p>&mdash;El escribano envía a su cliente copia de todas las piezas y sentencias
durante el primer acto del procedimiento. Los demás actos o autos se
presume que son conocidos de las partes con tal que<a name="FNanchor_29_902" id="FNanchor_29_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_902" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> hayan
transcurrido dos o tres días desde el en que fueron<a name="FNanchor_30_903" id="FNanchor_30_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_903" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> firmados por el
juez.</p>

<p>&mdash;Ese procedimiento supone una vigilancia minuciosa por parte de los
litigantes.</p>

<p>&mdash;Este cuidado se deja, por lo general, a cargo de los procuradores, que
representan a las partes. Cada litigante tiene el suyo.<a name="FNanchor_31_904" id="FNanchor_31_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_904" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Ellos toman
conocimiento a nombre de sus clientes de los autos del procedimiento,
que comunican, no a los litigantes, sino al abogado, el cual es en
realidad quien dirige el proceso.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿El abogado no ve nunca<a name="FNanchor_32_905" id="FNanchor_32_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_905" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> a sus clientes?</p>

<p>&mdash;Sí; éstos se comunican con aquél en su despacho, bufete o estudio.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII"></a>XXXVII.&mdash;¿QUÉ ES LA AMÉRICA LATINA?<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h3>

<p>&mdash;Usted me pregunta cuáles son las causas de la ignorancia que prevalece
en los Estados Unidos respecto de las repúblicas del sur. Por cierto
esas causas son numerosas; pero entre ellas yo señalaré una que no he
oído mencionar nunca.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Cuál es ella? Me tiene Ud. con<a name="FNanchor_1_906" id="FNanchor_1_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_906" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> curiosidad.</p>

<p>&mdash;Pues esa causa procede de un punto de vista propio del americano del
norte; punto de vista que resulta de abrazar a todos esos países en una
denominación común, como es la de<a name="FNanchor_2_907" id="FNanchor_2_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_907" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> América latina, con que se designa
el conjunto de las veinte repúblicas.</p>

<p>&mdash;La verdad es que no alcanzo ...</p>

<p>&mdash;Ud. se sonríe. Pero me explicaré. Ustedes agrupan a todos los países
que quedan al sur del Río Bravo del Norte (Río Grande) bajo un solo
nombre; el de América latina, o por lo menos el de América española
cuando excluyen de la cuenta al Brasil que habla otra lengua y al que
tal vez atribuyen tradiciones diferentes. Ahora bien, una designación
común crea en la mente la presunción de que existen semejanzas estrechas
entre todas las partes que concurren a formar ese todo.</p>

<p>&mdash;Me sorprende Ud. no poco.<a name="FNanchor_3_908" id="FNanchor_3_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_908" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> ¿Estamos equivocados al suponer que
existen mil rasgos comunes en la raza, la historia,<a name="page_175" id="page_175"></a> la tradición, la
religión, y el lenguaje de aquellas repúblicas, que justifican
plenamente la designación común que les damos?</p>

<p>&mdash;Muchas de esas semejanzas son de un orden teórico y no se confirman en
la realidad. Ya se lo probaré a Ud. luego.<a name="FNanchor_4_909" id="FNanchor_4_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_909" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Entretanto, observaré que
al atribuir a cada país los rasgos fundamentales que forman parte de un
concepto general de todos ellos, ustedes cometen errores en cada caso
particular. El punto de vista que ustedes han adoptado los prepara para
advertir semejanzas, y no para descubrir diferencias, siendo así que<a name="FNanchor_5_910" id="FNanchor_5_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_910" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
estas últimas están dando a los países latino-americanos la personalidad
a que aspiran en la familia de las naciones.</p>

<p>&mdash;Pero vamos a los hechos. Tomemos la raza. ¿No tienen Uds. a ese
respecto rasgos comunes?</p>

<p>&mdash;No tantos como nos distinguen.<a name="FNanchor_6_911" id="FNanchor_6_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_911" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Todas las combinaciones etnológicas
se hallan actualmente en movimiento en los países de la América latina.
Entre ellos tiene Ud. algunos donde el indio constituye las dos terceras
partes de la población; otros donde el negro predomina en igual
proporción; y por fin, países donde el indio y el negro son totalmente o
casi desconocidos.</p>

<p>Considere Ud. cuán distintos y complicados son los problemas de
educación y de gobierno que esas diferencias sugieren. Tenga Ud. en
cuenta, además, que hay, como quien dice,<a name="FNanchor_7_912" id="FNanchor_7_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_912" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> indios e indios; es decir,
que entre las razas nativas existen diferencias marcadas que imponen
modalidades y rasgos diferentes. No puede compararse el indio manso y
tolerante del trópico, con el<a name="page_176" id="page_176"></a> altivo indígena de más al sur, ni el
indio que vive en regiones que le ofrecen amplia subsistencia, con el
que habita comarcas donde la lucha es el precio de la vida.</p>

<p>&mdash;Bien está<a name="FNanchor_8_913" id="FNanchor_8_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_913" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> que la diversidad de sangres contribuya a diferenciar la
población en los distintos países de la América. Lo acepto, pero ¿y qué
de la historia<a name="FNanchor_9_914" id="FNanchor_9_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_914" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> y la tradición común?</p>

<p>&mdash;Permítame Ud.<a name="FNanchor_10_915" id="FNanchor_10_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_915" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>; la América latina no tiene una historia común; es
decir, una historia cuyos episodios unifiquen los sentimientos de los
individuos en la veneración de glorias comunes. A lo sumo,<a name="FNanchor_11_916" id="FNanchor_11_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_916" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> tal vez
pueda Ud. descubrir esa comunidad en ciertos distritos geográficos; pero
no es raro que la historia&mdash;esa historia a que Ud. atribuye la función
de vínculo&mdash;sea precisamente un elemento de alejamiento y de rivalidad.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Es posible?</p>

<p>&mdash;No sólo posible sino lógico también. Desde luego recuerde Ud. el largo
feudo, no terminado aún, entre los admiradores de Bolívar y los que
consideran a San Martín como el más grande de los dos.<a name="FNanchor_12_917" id="FNanchor_12_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_917" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> De tales
controversias están llenas las bibliotecas. Por otra parte, si el
comentario histórico es fuente de disensiones entre los propios, ¡cuánto
más no ha de<a name="FNanchor_13_918" id="FNanchor_13_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_918" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> serlo entre los extraños! Cruza Ud. una línea
fronteriza y encuentra Ud. que los héroes de un lado acaso son tenidos
como bandidos en el otro. ¿Y olvidó Ud. las guerras que tuvieron<a name="page_177" id="page_177"></a> o
pudieron tener lugar? Ellas han creado situaciones poco favorables a la
comunidad de miras desde el punto de vista histórico ....</p>

<p>&mdash;Confieso que no había reflexionado sobre las razones que Ud. expone, y
que me parecen irrefutables.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Lo ve Ud.? Sus palabras mismas demuestran que el punto de vista en
que ustedes se colocan y que los lleva a buscar semejanzas en toda la
América latina, también los inhabilita fatalmente para hacerse
reflexiones como las que acaba Ud. de aceptar.</p>

<p>&mdash;Comienzo a comprender sus argumentos; pero me cuesta mucho creer
que<a name="FNanchor_14_919" id="FNanchor_14_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_919" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> existan tantas líneas de divergencia en la sociedad de esos
países.</p>

<p>&mdash;No puede ser de otro modo<a name="FNanchor_15_920" id="FNanchor_15_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_920" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> si bien se mira,<a name="FNanchor_16_921" id="FNanchor_16_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_921" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> dadas las
condiciones geográficas distintas en que esos países se hallan. El estar
situados sobre el Atlántico o sobre el Pacífico, en el trópico o en la
zona templada, en el interior del continente o en la costa, en zonas
fértiles o ingratas, crea intereses diversos, si no antagónicos, y
fomenta ideales económicos contrapuestos.</p>

<p>&mdash;Sin embargo, no me doy todavía por vencido.<a name="FNanchor_17_922" id="FNanchor_17_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_922" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> ¿Qué me dice Ud. del
lenguaje? ¿No es ese un vínculo común muy poderoso, que hace de toda la
América hispánica una sola familia?<a name="page_178" id="page_178"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;Sin duda todos los hispanoamericanos hablamos la lengua de la madre
patria. Sin duda el más puro castellano<a name="FNanchor_18_923" id="FNanchor_18_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_923" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> puede circular, fuera del
Brasil, desde el río Bravo a Magallanes en la página impresa, en la
cátedra, en el discurso y la conferencia. Pero el idioma español adopta
dos formas, según que se emplee<a name="FNanchor_19_924" id="FNanchor_19_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_924" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> en asuntos de orden literario o en
las transacciones comunes de la vida. Este último idioma: el idioma de
la intimidad, el idioma del pueblo, es el que en realidad difiere del
español castizo, porque se ha enriquecido con nuevas voces desconocidas
en España, y con modismos innumerables.</p>

<p>&mdash;No obstante, ese lenguaje común debe ser un vínculo entre los pueblos
de las repúblicas hispanoamericanas....</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Pero sí esa<a name="FNanchor_20_925" id="FNanchor_20_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_925" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> diversificación es precisamente lo que las hace
extrañas unas a otras! Ha de saber Ud. que en el aislamiento en que
viven, cada una de esas repúblicas ha desarrollado por su lado el habla
popular<a name="FNanchor_21_926" id="FNanchor_21_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_926" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>; cada una ha amoldado el idioma hablado al ambiente físico
peculiar, a las ocupaciones y tradiciones locales. Muchos diccionarios
se han escrito donde se catalogan los argentinismos, chilenismos,
peruanismos, mejicanismos, cubanismos, etc. Debo agregar que los
americanismos de un país son, por lo general, desconocidos en los otros;
y a mayor abundamiento,<a name="FNanchor_22_927" id="FNanchor_22_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_927" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> una misma voz suele recibir diferentes
significados según el país en que se emplea. Tiene Ud. la palabra
<i>cacho</i>: en Guatemala <i>echar un cacho</i> significa embriagarse; pero en
Colombia <i>echar el cacho</i> quiere decir aventajar y superar.<a name="page_179" id="page_179"></a> <i>Cacho</i> en
Chile es sinónimo de cosa invendible, al paso que en la Argentina es un
racimo de plátanos o bananas. ¿Cómo no quiere Ud., pues, que<a name="FNanchor_23_928" id="FNanchor_23_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_928" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> el
habitante de una nación latinoamericana se sienta extranjero en las
otras?</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Pero va Ud. ahora a decirme que Uds. no se visitan, que no comercian,
que no se entienden? La comunicación, que imagino existe entre Uds.,
debe engendrar un sentimiento común, un sobrentendido de semejanza,
resultado de la amistad y el conocimiento recíproco.</p>

<p>&mdash;Pues contra lo que Ud. supone,<a name="FNanchor_24_929" id="FNanchor_24_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_929" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> no nos tratamos<a name="FNanchor_25_930" id="FNanchor_25_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_930" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> y, por lo
tanto, no nos conocemos<a name="FNanchor_26_931" id="FNanchor_26_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_931" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> .... Desde luego las comunicaciones son
difíciles y caras. Estudie Ud. el mapa de las vías de comunicación
terrestres entre los estados vecinos de la América latina y verá Ud. qué
deficiente<a name="FNanchor_27_932" id="FNanchor_27_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_932" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> es el tráfico internacional, aún en las pequeñas y
próximas repúblicas de Centro América. Chile, Argentina, Brasil,
Paraguay y Bolivia están en comunicación por el riel; pero ¡qué
distancias tan enormes<a name="FNanchor_28_933" id="FNanchor_28_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_933" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>! Así se explica que en cada ciudad o pueblo
latinoamericano hay más representantes de cualquiera de las principales
naciones de Europa que de las vecinas de América.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Quiere Ud. decir que tampoco comercian Uds.?<a name="page_180" id="page_180"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;A eso iba.<a name="FNanchor_29_934" id="FNanchor_29_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_934" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> ¿Ni cómo podría ser de otro modo?<a name="FNanchor_30_935" id="FNanchor_30_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_935" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> No hallándose
desarrollada la industria, esos países exportan sus frutos a Europa o a
Estados Unidos y reciben en cambio los productos manufacturados. El
intercambio de la Argentina con todas las repúblicas hispanoamericanas
juntas<a name="FNanchor_31_936" id="FNanchor_31_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_936" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> es menor que el comercio entre la Argentina y Holanda, para
mencionar<a name="FNanchor_32_937" id="FNanchor_32_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_937" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> uno de los países de Europa con el cual el intercambio
argentino es menos activo. El comercio del Paraguay con Francia es
cuatro veces más fuerte que el que mantiene con su vecino el Brasil. Por
cada millón del comercio de este último país con la Argentina, hay que
contar dos entre el Brasil y Alemania, país con el que, a su vez, el
Uruguay comercia en una escala tres veces mayor que lo hace con<a name="FNanchor_33_938" id="FNanchor_33_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_938" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> la
Argentina. El comercio del Ecuador con Perú y Chile, que casi constituye
la totalidad de su intercambio con Sud América, es cinco veces menor que
el que mantiene con Inglaterra; entre Chile y Estados Unidos se cambian
operaciones comerciales por un monto siete veces mayor que las entre
Chile y su vecino el Perú. Nicaragua comercia con las otras cuatro
repúblicas de Centro América menos que con Italia; y si Ud. suma el
intercambio que mantiene Méjico con toda la América Central y del Sur,
descubrirá que es ochenta veces menor que el intercambio con los Estados
Unidos, el cual a su vez es tan sólo un veinticinco avos<a name="FNanchor_34_939" id="FNanchor_34_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_939" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> de todo el
comercio exterior de este último país.</p>

<p>&mdash;Me deja Ud. perplejo; y comprendo ahora que las repúblicas<a name="page_181" id="page_181"></a> americanas
no tengan oportunidad de conocerse y tratarse.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Lo ve Ud.? La ignorancia recíproca es consecuencia natural del
aislamiento en que viven. Estoy seguro que los niños de escuela en el
Brasil saben más acerca de la geografía del Japón que de Chile; y sería
una sorpresa encontrar un escolar boliviano que recitara con más
corrección la lista de los estados mejicanos que la de los cantones de
Suiza. Nombres de latinoamericanos ilustres en las letras, las artes o
las ciencias, son menos conocidos en los países limítrofes que los de
personajes secundarios en el escenario europeo.</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Es singular!</p>

<p>&mdash;Sin embargo, mencionaré un punto en que las aspiraciones de todos esos
países coinciden....</p>

<p>&mdash;Diga Ud., pues estoy impaciente por ganarle siquiera un punto.</p>

<p>&mdash;No se haga Ud. ilusiones,<a name="FNanchor_35_940" id="FNanchor_35_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_940" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> pues esa aspiración es nada menos
que<a name="FNanchor_36_941" id="FNanchor_36_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_941" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> la de mantenerse separados, distintos; la de crear una
conciencia nacional; la de preparar y consolidar tradiciones propias que
definan y circunscriban esas nacientes nacionalidades y les dé una
fisonomía y una personalidad. Si Ud. procura ser agradable a un
ciudadano de cualquiera de esas repúblicas, evite mencionarle lo que a
sus ojos pueda ser indicio de que Ud. no tiene una idea precisa del
medio geográfico y la sociedad de donde aquél procede. Le ofenderá Ud.,
no porque con ello despierte Ud. una baja emulación en su alma, sino
porque Ud. le da a entender con eso que su país no ha salido todavía del
conglomerado uniforme de la «América latina»....<a name="page_182" id="page_182"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;Me temo que esa designación común ha acabado por ser poco simpática a
los latinoamericanos.</p>

<p>&mdash;Veo que me ha comprendido Ud. Ese doble término no puede abrazar los
rasgos que distinguen a dichas nacionalidades, y entre esos rasgos que
las distinguen se cuentan precisamente los que más caracterizan sus
progresos recientes. Si algo significa la designación<a name="FNanchor_37_942" id="FNanchor_37_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_942" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> «América
latina»: es decir, si algo tienen de común esas repúblicas, tal
comunidad habría necesariamente de encontrarse en los resabios de su
existencia primitiva, caracterizada por revoluciones, atraso e
ignorancia. Ud. lo ha dicho: el término es poco simpático; y en verdad
no conozco mejor elogio que pueda hacerse de cualquiera de esas
repúblicas que el de señalarla como la menos latinoamericana de las
repúblicas latinoamericanas ... ¡Crea Ud. que a ese ideal aspiran todas
en el noble sentido de tal exclusión!</p>

<p>&mdash;Aseguro a Ud. que esta conversación ha cambiado profundamente mi punto
de vista con respecto a la América lat ...! ¡Perdóneme Ud.! Iba a
repetir un término que no tiene significación alguna.</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Oh, sí la tiene! Pero no olvide Ud. que esa significación es sólo
geográfica.</p>

<h4><a name="I-1" id="I-1"></a>1.&mdash;EL ÑANDÚ: AVESTRUZ AMERICANO<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h4>

<p>El avestruz de América, que los Indios guaraníes llaman <i>ñandú y churí</i>,
habita las provincias de Tucumán y Salta, el Paraguay, las llanuras de
Montevideo, las pampas de Buenos Aires, y se dice que hay de estas aves
hasta en<a name="FNanchor_1_943" id="FNanchor_1_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_943" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> el estrecho de Magallanes. Prefieren el campo raso<a name="FNanchor_2_944" id="FNanchor_2_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_944" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> a los
bosques, y se asocian por pares y a veces en bandadas<a name="FNanchor_3_945" id="FNanchor_3_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_945" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> de más de
treinta individuos. Donde no se les molesta, se acercan a las
habitaciones campestres y no huyen de la gente de a pie<a name="FNanchor_4_946" id="FNanchor_4_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_946" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>; pero donde
se acostumbra darles caza,<a name="FNanchor_5_947" id="FNanchor_5_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_947" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> son en extremo ariscas, y huyen con tanta
velocidad que aun con buenos caballos es dificultoso alcanzarlas. Los
cazadores les tiran al cuello una especie de lazo que termina en tres
ramales, cada uno de éstos con una gruesa piedra en su extremidad.
Cuando el ñandú ha sido enlazado y atajado en su carrera, es necesario
que el cazador se le acerque con precaución,<a name="FNanchor_6_948" id="FNanchor_6_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_948" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> pues aunque no ofende
con el pico, tira coces<a name="FNanchor_7_949" id="FNanchor_7_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_949" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> capaces de quebrantar las piedras. Cuando van
a todo<a name="page_184" id="page_184"></a> correr,<a name="FNanchor_8_950" id="FNanchor_8_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_950" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> llevan las alas tendidas hacia atrás, y mudan
frecuentemente de dirección, abriendo una de ellas, con lo que<a name="FNanchor_9_951" id="FNanchor_9_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_951" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> el
viento les ayuda a ejecutar rápidamente estas vueltas, que frustran los
movimientos del cazador. Cuando están tranquilos, su porte es grave, su
modo de<a name="FNanchor_10_952" id="FNanchor_10_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_952" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> andar majestuoso, con la cabeza y el cuello enhiestos y la
espalda arqueada. Para pacer, bajan el cuello y la cabeza y cortan la
yerba de que se alimentan.</p>

<p>Los pollos que se crían en las casas se hacen mansos y familiares desde
el primer día, entran en todos los aposentos, se pasean por las calles,
salen al campo y vuelven a casa. Son curiosos y se paran a las ventanas
y puertas para atisbar lo que pasa en el interior. Comen granos, pan y
otros alimentos; no desdeñan las moscas y demás insectos volantes, que
atrapan diestramente en el aire; tragan también piezas de metal,
monedas, y aún las piedrezuelas que encuentran. La carne de los pollos
es tierna y de buen gusto,<a name="FNanchor_11_953" id="FNanchor_11_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_953" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> la de los adultos no vale nada.<a name="FNanchor_12_954" id="FNanchor_12_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_954" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Los naturales del Río de la Plata separan el cuello entero y parte del
ñandú, los despluman y limpian, suavizan el cuero, y abriéndolo por la
extremidad inferior, hacen talegos, que llaman <i>chuspas</i>.</p>

<p>Las plumas alares se mandaban a España, donde solían emplearlas en
plumeros, penachos y adornos de damas; las blancas (que se hallan debajo
de las alas) son las más estimadas, porque se pueden teñir y rizar como
se quiera.<a name="FNanchor_13_955" id="FNanchor_13_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_955" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<h4><a name="I-2" id="I-2"></a>2.&mdash;EL COTOPAXI<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h4>

<p>Está situado este volcán a ocho leguas N. N. E.<a name="FNanchor_1_956" id="FNanchor_1_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_956" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> de Tacunga. Ninguna
montaña en América presenta una belleza tan caracterizada como el
Cotopaxi: Su forma es enteramente la de un cono truncado de exacta
regularidad; su nieve es purísima, y su distribución<a name="FNanchor_2_957" id="FNanchor_2_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_957" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> en las faldas se
hace con tanta simetría, que es casi imposible contemplar, desde una
distancia tan considerable como la en que se percibe esta bellísima
montaña, un espectáculo más agradable, más brillante, ni<a name="FNanchor_3_958" id="FNanchor_3_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_958" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> más
apacible. En las tardes de verano, especialmente cuando la atmósfera
pura del Ecuador se encuentra libre de vapores y de nubes, las faldas
argentadas de este rarísimo nevado, vistas de lejos,<a name="FNanchor_4_959" id="FNanchor_4_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_959" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> arrebatan el
alma, aún de las personas que tienen menos hábito y menos propensiones a
contemplar con entusiasmo las obras magnas de la creación. El color de
esta montaña varía como el del camaleón, según la dirección y modo como
la hieren los rayos solares: A veces es enteramente blanca; en
ocasiones,<a name="FNanchor_5_960" id="FNanchor_5_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_960" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> bañada por la luz del sol poniente,<a name="FNanchor_6_961" id="FNanchor_6_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_961" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> parece una gran
masa de oro bruñido; y otras veces las sombras nacidas de la
distribución de las numerosas rocas repartidas en toda su superficie,
desde su elevada cima hasta su anchurosa base, le dan un aspecto
semi-violado, con tintes purpurinos notables y espléndidos. En su
cúspide truncada hay, con frecuencia, una columna de humo, y sucede de<a name="page_186" id="page_186"></a>
cuando en cuando que, durante la noche, arroja por su cráter, a manera
de bomba, y de un modo intermitente, algunas substancias inflamadas;
gracias a este respiradero que se ha formado, y que desembaraza sus
entrañas de los productos de una combustión permanente, los pueblos del
Ecuador no experimentan frecuentes temblores ni violentos terremotos,
porque este nevado apacible, como hemos dicho, quieto, calmado e
inofensivo en la apariencia, contiene en su seno el germen de la
devastación, de la ruina y la desolación de los lugares circunvecinos,
como lo ha demostrado en sus diversas erupciones.</p>

<h4><a name="I-3" id="I-3"></a>3.&mdash;EL OMBÚ<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h4>

<p>Uno de los caracteres distintivos del ombú es su longevidad dilatada,
condición requerida en un ser que con dificultad se reproduce. No se
conoce el término de su vida; nadie ha visto hasta ahora un ombú seco de
vejez,<a name="FNanchor_1_962" id="FNanchor_1_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_962" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> ni hay tradición que recuerde la edad juvenil de algunos. Por
las enormes dimensiones de muchos de ellos, con treinta varas de
circunferencia en su monstruosa raíz y diez en su tronco, puede juzgarse
que tienen miles de años de existencia.</p>

<p>Además de su extraordinaria longevidad, tiene el ombú tal fortaleza que
no hay huracán que lo derribe<a name="FNanchor_2_963" id="FNanchor_2_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_963" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>; y es su vitalidad tan prodigiosa que
ni la sequedad ni el fuego tienen poder para destruirlo. Si por acaso
algún violento torbellino llega a destrozar su copa, muy pronto se
rehace con asombroso vigor y doble lozanía.<a name="page_187" id="page_187"></a></p>

<p>El ha resistido las sequías destructoras que, de tiempo en tiempo, han
asolado las campiñas....</p>

<p>El ombú prospera en los lugares más áridos, y en toda clase de terrenos,
con tal de que no tenga una humedad excesiva. Sólo se multiplica por la
semilla, y es preciso, mientras es pequeño, ponerlo a cubierto de las
heladas. Trasplantándolo joven, no requiere ya ningún otro cuidado, ni
el del riego, y a los cuatro o cinco años es un árbol frondoso.</p>

<p>No hay árbol como el ombú para formar umbrosas alamedas o avenidas
arboladas. La naturaleza de nuestro clima, madrastra de los árboles
exóticos, parece que les niega el sustento; exigen la solicitud y
constante atención del hombre. El ombú, su hijo predilecto, prospera
admirablemente sin necesidad de sus cuidados.</p>

<h4><a name="I-4" id="I-4"></a>4.&mdash;VEGETACIÓN DE LOS ANDES<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h4>

<p>¡Qué diferentes son las selvas de Santiago de las de las cercanías de
Quito! La altura de los árboles crece en razón inversa de<a name="FNanchor_1_964" id="FNanchor_1_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_964" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> la
elevación del suelo en que nacen. En las costas son colosales, y los
diámetros enormes, los troncos derechos, perpendiculares, y dejando
entre sí grandes espacios vacíos. Las lianas abundan en extremo.
Maromas, cables semejantes a los de un grueso navío, bajan y suben, unas
veces perpendiculares, otras envolviéndose espiralmente al rededor de
los troncos. Aquí forman bóvedas, allí techos que no pueden penetrar los
ardientes rayos del sol. Las palmeras, estos orgullosos individuos de
las selvas inflamadas, levantan a los aires sus copas majestuosas, y
descuellan sobre cuanto las rodea. Pocos musgos revisten los<a name="page_188" id="page_188"></a> troncos.
Las raíces someras se extienden horizontalmente a distancias
prodigiosas. Un huracán, una ráfaga de viento arranca con facilidad
estas masas inmensas que parecía desafiaban a todas las convulsiones y a
la duración misma de los siglos. En su ruina envuelven todo cuanto
existe en su vecindad. Hombres, animales, plantas, todo queda oprimido
bajo su mole. El silencio augusto que reina en estas soledades en medio
de la noche, se interrumpe con frecuencia con el ruido espantoso que
causa su caída. No es el diente, no<a name="FNanchor_2_965" id="FNanchor_2_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_965" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> las garras del tigre, no el
veneno mortal de la serpiente lo que más se teme en el fondo de estas
selvas. Los vientos, las dislocaciones del aire ponen pálido al viajero
y le sacan de su lecho. ¡Cuántas veces turbó mi reposo una aura ligera
seguida de un crujido! A cada paso hemos hallado espacios de ciento, de
doscientas varas,<a name="FNanchor_3_966" id="FNanchor_3_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_966" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> cubiertos de palizadas provenientes de la ruina de
un árbol que desplomaron los años y los vientos....</p>

<p>Si los hombres son diferentes, la vegetación de nuestros Andes parece
que toca en los extremos. En el corto espacio de veinte leguas halla el
botánico observador plantas análogas a las de la Siberia, plantas
semejantes a las de los Alpes, la vegetación de Bengala y la de Tartaria
septentrional. Basta descender cinco mil varas para pasar de los musgos
del polo a las selvas del Ecuador. Dos pulgadas de más en el barómetro
hacen mudar de faz el imperio de Flora.<a name="FNanchor_4_967" id="FNanchor_4_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_967" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Los bálsamos, las resinas,
los aromas, los venenos, los antídotos, todas las cualidades enérgicas
están en la base de nuestra soberbia cordillera. Los cereales,<a name="page_189" id="page_189"></a> las
hortalizas, los pastos, las propiedades benignas están sobre sus faldas.
En las simas se han refugiado las gramíneas, los musgos, y la mayor
parte de las criptógamas. Aquí se vuelven a hallar cualidades enérgicas
en algunas plantas. Los extremos, ya lo hemos dicho, se tocan.<a name="FNanchor_5_968" id="FNanchor_5_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_968" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<h4><a name="I-5" id="I-5"></a>5.&mdash;EL BOSQUE DE CHAPULTEPEC<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h4>

<p>Venid a este bosque, hombres que amáis la soledad y que buscáis
inspiraciones. Veréis qué bello es, cuando en la alborada del día
interrumpen las aves con sus silbidos el silencio con que se adormecía
aquella naturaleza salvaje y misteriosa. La cumbre de los árboles más
colosales<a name="FNanchor_1_969" id="FNanchor_1_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_969" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> se ilumina con el albor de la mañana, y entonces resaltan
más esas sombras, entre las que se mecen suavemente las ramas de la
selva. Por entre<a name="FNanchor_2_970" id="FNanchor_2_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_970" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> esas ramas flotantes y sombrías, pasan algunos rayos
de luz, y uno que otro pájaro atraviesa esas ráfagas, volando perezoso.</p>

<p>Al medio día, la luz del sol cae sobre el bosque como una gasa de oro
que flota entre las ramas. Entonces sorprende más ese hermoso contraste
de sombras y de luz, que hace aquel sitio tan bello y misterioso. Uno
que otro graznido, uno que otro canto interrumpe el silencio del bosque;
porque las aves van en aquella hora a buscar sombra y frescura hasta la
cumbre de los ahuehuetes, y a esconderse del sol entre los ramosos
brazos de aquellos árboles.<a name="page_190" id="page_190"></a></p>

<p>En la tarde, el cielo se tiñe en occidente de rosicler y nácar, se
inunda con un fulgor purpúreo, o se extiende en él un velo de topacio.
Sobre esa tela de luz que flota en el ocaso, veréis cómo se diseñan con
sus grandiosas formas, con sus membrudos brazos y sombrío ramaje
aquellos ahuehuetes que, aislados y dispersos, forman en el bosque
grupos pintorescos. Entonces vaga entre ellos ese pájaro que llaman
<i>crepuscular</i>, porque sale a cazar insectos a la hora en que el lucero
de la tarde<a name="FNanchor_3_971" id="FNanchor_3_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_971" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> centellea entre las ramas de la selva. ¡Qué vago se
percibe entonces en esta soledad el rumor de la corte populosa y el eco
sonoro de las campanas, cuya voz resuena majestuosa, cuando el ángel de
la oración baja a la tierra!</p>

<p>En la noche, la oscuridad del bosque es imponente, misterioso el
silencio de aquel vasto recinto, y poético el murmurio del viento
rumoroso.</p>

<p>¡Qué majestuosos sois, soberbios ahuehuetes, y qué venerable vuestro
aspecto, cubiertos con ese parásito ceniciento que crece sobre vuestras
ramas y brazos gigantescos! Al veros envueltos en él, se diría que<a name="FNanchor_4_972" id="FNanchor_4_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_972" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> el
tiempo había ido acumulando sobre vosotros el polvo de los siglos. Ni
las tempestades, ni el huracán os despojan jamás de ese manto verde y
ondeante que os hace tan hermosos. ¡Vivid aún por muchos siglos,<a name="FNanchor_5_973" id="FNanchor_5_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_973" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
árboles excelsos, que tantas veces habéis visto estallar sobre vuestras
cabezas el rayo de los cielos!</p>

<p>¡Ah! si en la soledad hay algunos genios que se recreen en contemplar
las bellezas salvajes de una naturaleza vigorosa, magnífica y fecunda,
yo les pido que sean propicios para vosotros, y que os preserven de la
barbarie de los hombres. ¡Ojalá<a name="page_191" id="page_191"></a> la presente generación no llegue a ver
por el suelo vuestros enormes troncos, ni mutilados vuestros brazos, ni
marchito el verdor de vuestras ramas! ¡Ojalá un siglo que presume de<a name="FNanchor_6_974" id="FNanchor_6_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_974" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
civilizado conserve y embellezca cada día más ese bosque que los
antiguos veneraron como sagrado y que dejaron a su posteridad como un
monumento de civilización, como resto magnífico de una vegetación
salvaje, exuberante y prodigiosa!</p>

<h4><a name="I-6" id="I-6"></a>6.&mdash;LA SELVA TROPICAL<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h4>

<p>Enumerar las miriadas de animales que pueblan la selva, sería imposible.
Encima es un interminable ruido de aves que ora sacuden las ramas al
volar pesadamente, como las pavas y <i>paujíes</i>, ora<a name="FNanchor_1_975" id="FNanchor_1_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_975" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> alegran el oído y
la vista como los jilgueros, las diminutas <i>quinchas</i> (colibrí), o el
<i>sol-y-luna</i>, pájaro de silencioso vuelo, brillante cual mariposa,<a name="FNanchor_2_976" id="FNanchor_2_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_976" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
llevando en las alas la figura del sol y de la luna en creciente, de
donde le viene su nombre. Al rededor remueven el ramaje multitud de
cuadrúpedos, y los inquietos <i>zambos</i> (monos) corren saltando de árbol
en árbol a atisbar con curiosidad al transeunte, las hembras con los
hijuelos cargados a la espalda,<a name="FNanchor_3_977" id="FNanchor_3_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_977" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> y todos juntos en familia,<a name="FNanchor_4_978" id="FNanchor_4_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_978" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
chiflando y arrojando ramas secas; mientras más a lo lejos<a name="FNanchor_5_979" id="FNanchor_5_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_979" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> los
<i>araguatos</i> (monos aulladores), sentados gravemente en torno del más
viejo, entonan una especie de letanía en que el jefe gruñe primero y los
demás le contestan en coro. Bajo los pies y por entre la yerba y
hojarasca<a name="page_192" id="page_192"></a> se deslizan culebras de mil matices, haciéndose notar la
cazadora por su corpulencia y timidez, y la <i>lomo-de-machete</i>, de índole
fiera, cuerpo vigoroso, coronada de cresta y armada de una sierra que
eriza sobre el lomo al avistar al hombre, lo que afortunadamente sucede
raras veces. En ocasiones saltan de repente<a name="FNanchor_6_980" id="FNanchor_6_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_980" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> lagartos enormes,
parecidos a las iguanas, y huyen revolviendo la basura del suelo; en

de un andar lento al través de la maleza; de continuo<a name="FNanchor_7_981" id="FNanchor_7_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_981" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> y por todas
partes la animación de la naturaleza en el esplendor de su abandono; y a
raros intervalos, a orillas del camino y escondida se encuentra la choza
miserable de algún vecino de Guayabito, pálido y enfermizo: el hombre
está de más<a name="FNanchor_8_982" id="FNanchor_8_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_982" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> en medio de aquellas selvas, y sucumbe sin energía, como

<h4><a name="I-9" id="I-9"></a>9.&mdash;LA CALANDRIA: EL RUISEÑOR DE AMÉRICA<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h4>

<p>Uno de los pájaros americanos que por la hermosura de su canto ha
arrebatado la admiración del mundo antiguo, denominado por los
naturalistas, <i>mimus</i> o burlón y polígloto (que habla muchas lenguas),
ha recibido entre nosotros el nombre inadecuado de calandria, siendo así
que ni aun<a name="FNanchor_1_988" id="FNanchor_1_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_988" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> pertenece al género de esta alondra, sino al de los
mirlos. Es el mismo burlos de la Luisiana, la tenca de Chile, el
<i>cenzonte</i> o sinsonte de Méjico; nombres todos alusivos a la facultad
que posee este pájaro de imitar el canto de las demás aves, y aún el
grito de algunos cuadrúpedos.</p>

<p>Nuestra calandria tiene un ropaje pardo y sin brillo. M. Lesson,
examinando una, muerta en los alrededores de Montevideo, la encontró de
una extraordinaria semejanza con la especie de Cuba y de los Estados
Unidos. La parte superior de su cuerpo es de un color ceniciento
obscuro, con listas blancas en las alas; tiene unas manchas blancas
sobre los ojos, figurando grandes cejas; su pecho es cenizoso y su
vientre blanquecino. Lejos de hacer daño en los sembrados y jardines,
persigue las orugas y en el invierno destruye las crisálidas que las
harían pulular después de su transformación. Es difícil tenerla
enjaulada si no se ha criado en casa, a causa quizá de ser de una
naturaleza tan viva que no se para jamás, pues hasta para cantar va
saltando o revoloteando. A poco tiempo de hallarse sin libertad, muere
consumida de tristeza. Es sin embargo un ave bastante familiar y con
cierta inclinación al hombre, pues se la ve acercarse con frecuencia a
su morada, complaciéndose en cantar a su presencia.</p>

<h4><a name="I-10" id="I-10"></a>10.&mdash;UNA MAÑANA EN LOS ANDES<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h4>

<p>Eran las cuatro de la mañana y estábamos todos a caballo.</p>

<p>Antes de las seis coronaríamos la altura de los Andes occidentales, a
donde nos proponíamos subir.</p>

<p>El frío era intenso, pues había caído bastante escarcha<a name="FNanchor_1_989" id="FNanchor_1_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_989" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>; pero en
cambio ¡qué cielo tan limpio y espléndido!</p>

<p>La luna, rodeada de grupos de estrellas, cual un jefe victorioso en
medio de sus guerrillas dispersas en inmenso campo, avanzaba majestuosa
como si fuese a buscar descanso tras las sombrías sombras<a name="FNanchor_2_990" id="FNanchor_2_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_990" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> que tenía
detrás.</p>

<p>No humeaban aún las cabañas de los labradores, que semejaban gigantes
aves acurrucadas y dormidas aquí y allá a diestra y siniestra<a name="FNanchor_3_991" id="FNanchor_3_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_991" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> del
camino.</p>

<p>El silencio era profundo, e interrumpíanle sólo el ruido de nuestra
cabalgata, el ladrido de algún perro alarmado por él, y el canto triste
y monótono del gallo, que a largos intervalos sonaba en una lejana choza
y era contestado en otra, como el <i>¡alerta!</i> del centinela de la
soledad.</p>

<p>Jadeaban los caballos al avanzar por la empinada cuesta, y el vapor de
sus cuerpos sudorosos calentaba a los jinetes, algunos de los cuales
buscaban también este beneficio en el cigarro cuya punta brillaba como
una luciérnaga.</p>

<h4><a name="I-11" id="I-11"></a>11.&mdash;PERSONIFICACIÓN DE LAS AVES<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h4>

<p>Ciertos animales, y en especial las aves, por su aspecto, por sus
instintos o por su manera de vivir, parecen imitar las cualidades de la
persona o ejecutar aquellas cosas de que sólo es capaz un ser racional.
La imaginación, a vista de ello,<a name="FNanchor_1_992" id="FNanchor_1_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_992" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> se complace en fingir dotados a esos
animales de las cualidades humanas que de un modo más o menos patente
remedan, o bien en atribuirles los mismos oficios o ministerios que el
hombre ejerce. Así, en las vastas regiones en que se extiende la cuenca
del Plata, hallamos <i>horneros</i>, <i>leñeros</i>, <i>pedreros</i>, <i>carpinteros</i>,
<i>herreros</i>, <i>boyeros</i>, etc. El <i>dominico</i> se cubre con una blanquísima
vestimenta. Ostenta un rojo copete, semejante al capelo, el erguido y
airoso <i>cardenal</i>, tan abundante como arisco, de color gris negro el
cuerpo. Muy escaso y retirado en el Paraguay, entre sus variedades,
figura el que llamaron los guaraníes, <i>araguirá</i>, es decir, <i>pájaro del
día</i> o <i>de la luz</i>, con alusión a lo brillante y subido de su rojo
penacho. Con triste y prolongado acento, a la orilla de los ríos, se
lamenta de la pérdida de su fortuna el <i>hidalgo pobre</i>. Vístese de
blanco y negro, con tanta gracia como modestia, la sencilla <i>monjita</i>.
Lleva en la cabeza una toca, símbolo del duelo del amor, la no menos
graciosa <i>viuda</i>. Contemplando al astro majestuoso del día,<a name="FNanchor_2_993" id="FNanchor_2_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_993" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> yace el
mirasol en los bañados. Echado en el suelo, como un haragán enemigo del
trabajo, yace el <i>dormilón</i>. El negro <i>charrúa</i> hace el nido en las
barrancas, y, como el indio salvaje del Uruguay, da un fortísimo silbido
destemplado, algo semejante al relincho del caballo. Entre los siete
colores que singularizan al <i>naranjero</i>, muestra sobre su<a name="page_197" id="page_197"></a> pecho el
anaranjado como distintivo de sus aficiones: la naranja es su manjar
predilecto, si bien gusta de otras frutas y de las legumbres, haciendo
no poco daño en las huertas. Trepado en el árbol, agujerea la naranja y
come su carne, dejando entera la cáscara....</p>

<p>El boyero remeda melodiosamente con el canto el modo particular que
tienen los labriegos que cuidan bueyes de hacerse obedecer de estos
pacíficos animales. Quieren que<a name="FNanchor_3_994" id="FNanchor_3_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_994" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> el benteveo indique con sus repetidos
gritos la acción de la persona que está observando lo que otra ejecuta.
Azara advierte que los españoles le daban el nombre de bienteveo y los
guaraníes el de <i>puitaguá</i>; porque a los unos y a los otros
respectivamente les parecía que pronunciaba con claridad estas
palabras....</p>

<p>El <i>rayador</i>, hacia el amanecer, así como al anochecer, volando a flor
de<a name="FNanchor_4_995" id="FNanchor_4_995"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_995" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> agua, va rayando la superficie del río o de la laguna con la
mandíbula inferior sumergida, bien abierta su grande boca, a efecto
de<a name="FNanchor_5_996" id="FNanchor_5_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_996" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> tragar los pescadillos que encuentra al paso. La forma del pico no
le permite cazar de otro modo en tierra ni en el agua.</p>

<p>El <i>herrero</i> es un pájaro blanco, con la frente verdoso-cobriza, del
tamaño de una tórtola, pero menos grueso de cuerpo, y cuyo canto se
asemeja al ruido que hacen la lima y el martillo, cuando con ellos están
alternativamente limando y dando martillazos en un pedazo de lámina de
hierro: <i>chriiii tan</i>, <i>chriiii tan</i>, <i>chriiii tan</i>. El leñero o
espinero, pájaro pequeño, de color pardo, hace un enorme nido en los
árboles bajos, postes y cercados de las chacras y estancias, con
multitud de palitos y de largas y recias espinas de plantas
diversas....<a name="page_198" id="page_198"></a></p>

<p>El <i>terutero</i>, llamado <i>tetéu</i> en el Paraguay, nombre imitativo de su
modo de gritar, alborota, si no tanto, poco menos que el bullicioso
carpintero, cuando ve gente, a la que suele seguir buen trecho
incomodándola con su algazara. De noche en las casas (pues se domestica
fácilmente) y en el campo grita asimismo descompasadamente, apenas
siente algún rumor o advierte una novedad que le causa extrañeza. Por
eso dicen desde muy antiguo que el terutero es enemigo de los
contrabandistas....</p>

<p>Lleva el nombre de <i>hornero</i> o <i>casero</i> un pájaro amigo del hombre cuyas
casas busca para construir en sus cornisas, en los árboles que las
rodean o en los postes de sus corrales, un fuerte nido de barro que se
asemeja exteriormente a un horno de cocer pan. El pájaro no alcanza a
tener una cuarta de longitud desde el pico a la punta de la cola. Tira
ésta al color rojo,<a name="FNanchor_6_997" id="FNanchor_6_997"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_997" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> el pecho es blanco y el resto del cuerpo, en
general, pardo acanelado. Poco más de media cuarta tendrá el nido, cuya
entrada, más alta que ancha, se halla en un costado. Junto a uno de los
lados de la entrada hay un tabique, el cual deja en el fondo del
edificio una abertura que comunica con el aposento en que hace el nido
la pareja. El departamento contiguo, o que comunica directamente con la
entrada exterior, les sirve para guarecerse de la intemperie y para
evitar, con las dificultades que ofrece a los pájaros grandes, que los

en ciertas ocasiones del bullicio y de la animación de las ciudades
grandes, otras de la apacible quietud del pueblo pequeño, y siempre del
aroma y de la belleza de los jardines.</p>

<p>En efecto, en las llanuras de Bogotá reina una primavera eterna,
fenómeno que asombra a algunos extranjeros ignorantes que no alcanzan a
explicárselo. Aquí todo el año hay rosas, geranios, anémonas, jazmines y
las mil y mil flores que brotan bajo el cielo de las zonas templadas,
sin sentirse calor sofocante ni un frío que moleste. Pero al bajar la
cordillera, a medida que crece el calor cambia la vegetación; y el que
se asoma a gozar de este admirable paisaje descubriría, si no se lo
impidieran los pretiles del Salto, las palmeras, los naranjos, los
entables de caña de azúcar y los trapiches del pueblo de San Antonio de
Tena, a tiempo que<a name="FNanchor_1_1009" id="FNanchor_1_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1009" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> ve las rocas de Chinchas y de Canoas coronadas por
una selva de pinos y nogales, de robles y laureles. Abajo revuelan
clamoreando las pintadas guacamayas y se oye la voz de los verdes
papagayos habitadores de la zona tórrida; en tanto que arriba gime la
paloma torcaz y se cierne en las nubes el águila altanera.</p>

Sabana, sale de madre<a name="FNanchor_2_1010" id="FNanchor_2_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1010" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> como el Erídano, y no sólo inunda sus riberas,
sino que forma por el lado del poniente un lago de muchas leguas de
extensión .... Entonces se aumenta considerablemente el volumen de las

<p>De súbito nos sorprendió el espectáculo de uno de los ventisqueros, el
primero que veíamos en los canales, y también uno de los más pequeños,
cuya nieve llegaba hasta el mar, con tonos azulados suaves y tenues, muy
finos, que hacían resaltar más la blancura casi absoluta de la nieve en
la cima, destacada a su vez sobre el fondo plomizo del cielo. Hermoso
espectáculo que nos produjo profunda impresión, aunque entre nosotros
fuéramos varios<a name="FNanchor_1_1013" id="FNanchor_1_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1013" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> los que habíamos visto glaciares en los Andes. No<a name="page_203" id="page_203"></a> es

del mar, rodeados de vegetación, en medio de una temperatura agradable,
como la de un día plácido de primavera, y donde parecería que la nieve

<p>¡Qué sinnúmero de árboles diversos no se halla en esas selvas seculares!
¡Cuántas flores y arbustos delicados que envidiamos para nuestros
jardines! ¡Qué multitud de plantas trepadoras, que en vano se intenta
aclimatar en otras latitudes!</p>

<p>Al roble y la <i>patagua</i> se enlazan el <i>copihue</i> y la vid silvestre. El
manzano luce sus frutas doradas cerca del cedro bíblico, que se levanta
erguido, desafiando la furia de los vientos. No lejos están el madroño y
el laurel, en cuyas hojas brillantes han simbolizado los hombres la
gloria. Más allá se destaca el avellano con sus racimos de frutas, ora
verdes, ora amarillas, ora rojas o negras, según el grado de madurez que
han alcanzado, convidando a los niños con sus sabrosas almendras, que a
la vez les sirven para su alimento y para sus juegos. Por otro lado se
divisa el canelo de madera incorruptible y al que los indios atribuyen
cualidades mágicas; el <i>boldo</i>, cuyas secretas virtudes estudian con
afán médicos y botánicos, y por fin, el <i>litre</i>, árbol siniestro, del
cual se cuenta que da la muerte con su sombra. Y al tocarse los valles
con las cordilleras se presentan llenos de<a name="page_204" id="page_204"></a> majestad los interminables

<p>El montañés vive la vida de sus montañas, es orgulloso como ellas, tiene
su gravedad seria y risueña, ama su luz y sus sombras, y por eso es
ufano de su hogar. En las pampas está la inmensidad, la soledad, el
silencio, la abrumante igualdad de lugar y de tiempo: en las montañas,
el hombre halla horizontes limitados, que hace suyos y toca como si
fueran su propiedad; se siente acompañado por las colinas graciosas de
pendientes circulares y suaves, por los picos rocallosos y salvajes, por
los boscajes aislados y las mesetas de verdura; encuentra la animación
bulliciosa de la naturaleza en todas partes, en las voces del torrente
que se desata furioso entre las rocas de la quebrada, en los ruidos de
las auras que juguetean en las selvas, en los zumbidos del viento que se
choca en las cumbres sinuosas. Todo es variedad, lo bello al costado de
lo sublime,<a name="FNanchor_1_1017" id="FNanchor_1_1017"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1017" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> lo apacible<a name="page_205" id="page_205"></a> en seguida de lo adusto y sañudo, las

el silencio del bosque encima del bramido del torrente y debajo del

aleteo (cuyo zumbido originó su nombre), libando la miel de los

<p>Cuando desde una altura dominante se extiende la vista, abarcando
inmensa extensión de aquellos páramos, cerros tras cerros y pampas tras
pampas, todo aparece igual y repetido. En toda la travesía no se
encuentra una gota de agua, ni se ve ni se puede contar con un parapeto
que le permita ampararse para descansar un momento del incómodo y frío
viento que penetra por sobre todo abrigo; que del mismo modo no
encontrará un árbol, un peñasco, un algo<a name="FNanchor_1_1021" id="FNanchor_1_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1021" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> que le resguarde por un
instante del calor del sol que le abrasa y le persigue con una
intensidad que parece va aumentando segundo por segundo.<a name="FNanchor_2_1022" id="FNanchor_2_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1022" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Entonces es
el gran momento de la contemplación: la vista se pierde sin distinguir
señal alguna; el camino está por todas partes abierto, sin valla que se
interponga; cielo y tierra son uniformes en color y en aspecto; de un
lado todo celeste, de otro lado blanquizco, amarillento.</p>

<p>¡No se puede decir lo que hay allí! Las aguas, que ya vienen hostigadas,
corriendo en frenesí sobre un plano vastísimo, llegan<a name="page_207" id="page_207"></a> a la ceja inmensa
y se deslizan al vacío, o chocan, antes de saltar, con enormes peñascos,
y rebotan, y en los aires hacen juegos atléticos que la luz colorea con
mágicos cambiantes. Efusiones de plata, chorros ingentes, surtidores
sonoros que saltan en arco, anchos desbordamientos de aguas que
pesadamente se desploman con un mugido sordo, y al estrellarse en la
roca aplanada y fortísima, se deshacen en gigantescas nubes de vapor, de
un blanco inmaculado cuando surgen flotantes del hervoroso abismo y
luego teñidas de rosa, teñidas de carmín, de violeta traslúcido, o
hechas como de polvo de oro por el mágico sol. Y detrás de este
amontonamiento de saltos, y a la izquierda, y a la derecha,<a name="FNanchor_1_1023" id="FNanchor_1_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1023" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> cerca y
lejos, arriba, abajo, allá en las alturas, aquí a los pies, trenzándose
a pechadas con las rocas que, aunque aguantan, retiemblan, otros, y
otros, y otros saltos, cubriendo una superficie de cuatro mil metros:
unos con deslizamientos de culebra, otros con fieros brincos de jaguar,
unos obscuros, resbalando en silencio, otros vistosamente empenachados
de espuma, todos corren en vértigo y al llegar a la arista de los altos
y negros paredones, pierden pie<a name="FNanchor_2_1024" id="FNanchor_2_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1024" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> y ruedan al fatal e infinito
derrumbe, y allá abajo, reventados, deshechos, rugientes, siguen su
curso arrastrando en girones su túnica de encaje, mientras del uno al

dislocamiento de violencias, sobre aquel paroxismo, cien arco iris se
tienden como puentes de paz.</p>

<p>Hacia la parte del sud del sitio, de treinta varas de frente por
cuarenta de fondo, estaba la habitación única de la casa, dividida en
dos departamentos; uno sirviendo de dormitorio a nuestros padres, y el
mayor de sala de recibo, con su estrado alto y cojines, resto de las
tradiciones del diván árabe que han conservado los pueblos españoles.
Dos mesas de algarrobo indestructibles, que vienen pasando de mano en
mano<a name="FNanchor_1_1025" id="FNanchor_1_1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1025" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> desde los tiempos en que no había otra madera en San Juan que
los algarrobos de los campos, y algunas sillas de estructura desigual,
flanqueaban la sala, adornando las lisas murallas dos grandes cuadros al
óleo de Santo Domingo y San Vicente Ferrer, de malísimo pincel,<a name="FNanchor_2_1026" id="FNanchor_2_1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1026" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> pero

higuera, que sombreaba aún en mi infancia aquel telar de mi madre, cuyos
golpes y traqueteo de husos, pedales y lanzadera, nos despertaba antes
de salir el sol para anunciarnos que un nuevo día llegaba, y con él, la
necesidad de hacer, por el trabajo, frente<a name="FNanchor_4_1028" id="FNanchor_4_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1028" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> a las necesidades. Algunas
ramas de la higuera iban a frotarse contra las murallas de la casa, y
calentadas allí por la reverberación del<a name="page_209" id="page_209"></a> sol, sus frutos se anticipaban

<p>Andrés fué recibido en Colombia con la amabilidad característica de las
gentes<a name="FNanchor_1_1029" id="FNanchor_1_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1029" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> campesinas del país; que a pesar de las pocas comodidades de

mejor voluntad.</p>

<p>Las posadas de esos caminos no son hoteles sino casas de familia, donde
siempre el que lo ha menester<a name="FNanchor_3_1031" id="FNanchor_3_1031"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1031" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> encuentra una mesa «puesta»<a name="FNanchor_4_1032" id="FNanchor_4_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1032" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> y una
cama «tendida»<a name="FNanchor_5_1033" id="FNanchor_5_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1033" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> y corazones sencillos, cariñosos, que consideran la
hospitalidad como un favor que recibe quien lo da, como un deber
ordenado por Dios.</p>

<p>A la partida del viajero, cuando éste pregunta cuánto debe, contestan
casi siempre:</p>

<p>&mdash;Nada, señor, que le vaya bien<a name="FNanchor_6_1034" id="FNanchor_6_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_1034" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>....</p>

<p>En las colinas y faldas hay risueñas estancias, cuyas cercas dibujan
cuadriláteros en las laderas. Por sus contornos pacen libremente vacadas
y rebaños de ovejas. Las cabras saltan en los barrancos amarillos o se
suben a las grandes piedras. Óyense mujidos en los hatos y gritos de
pastores en las lomas.</p>

<p>Por allí pasó Andrés al sol de la mañana, admirado, encantado, dichoso.<a name="page_210" id="page_210"></a></p>

<p>Se detuvo un momento en uno de los corrales donde estaban ordeñando. Una
linda campesinita de negros ojos, de labios grosezuelos y rosada tez,
ordeñó una vaca de ternero grande y le pasó al viajero la vasija
rebosante que él mismo vió llenar. Arrimada al caballo esperó a que
bebiera, y cuando el joven le preguntó cuánto le debía, repuso:</p>

<p>&mdash;Nada, señor.</p>

<p>Entonces Andrés dió a la muchacha un gran ramo de alelíes, parásitas y
azucenas silvestres que había cogido en el camino, acompañando el
obsequio con una frase de elogio. La dulce niña recibió las flores y con
ella adornó su sombrero de paja, mientras sus compañeras reían. Entre
las risas, oíanse los chorros de leche al apagarse en los copos de
espuma.</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Qué creída!<a name="FNanchor_7_1035" id="FNanchor_7_1035"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_1035" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>&mdash;exclamó una de las ordeñadoras, asomando la cara
fresca y risueña por debajo de la ubre de una vaca.</p>

<p>El caballo era un bello animal,<a name="FNanchor_1_1036" id="FNanchor_1_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1036" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> negro como el azabache, y llevaba
sobre sus lomos una gruesa montura de pellones azules, al modo como<a name="FNanchor_2_1037" id="FNanchor_2_1037"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1037" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
hasta hoy la usan algunos de nuestros hombres de campo; pero tan bien
recortada y arreglada, que no se notaba en ella el menor defecto. Las
cabezas de la enjalma estaban completamente cubiertas de chapas de
plata, así como la mayor parte de los grandes estribos de madera,
curiosamente tallados, que a uno y otro lado de la montura pendían. Los
demás arreos<a name="page_211" id="page_211"></a> de la cabalgadura correspondían a lo que queda descrito.
Dos copas extraordinarias de plata, en forma de platillos cincelados,
adornaban el bocado; y las cabezadas y riendas estaban cubiertas de
argollas, pasadores, puntillas y cadenitas del mismo metal. Por último,
sería una omisión imperdonable<a name="FNanchor_3_1038" id="FNanchor_3_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1038" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> olvidar en esta descripción un lazo de

<p>El moro era un potro criollo, de corta alzada y un poco trasijado, pero
tan vivo, nervioso y rápido como un fino resorte de acero. Patricio se
miraba en él,<a name="FNanchor_5_1040" id="FNanchor_5_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1040" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> como suele decirse, porque no había otro caballo que le
llenara tanto el gusto<a name="FNanchor_6_1041" id="FNanchor_6_1041"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_1041" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> como ése; y hasta parecía que se entendían a
maravilla bestia y jinete. Cuando alguna vez era montado el moro por
algún otro ranchero, se mostraba tan mañoso y testarudo que ponía en
peligro la vida del valiente, y le dejaba desganado para volver a
cabalgarlo. Unas veces se «armaba», clavándose con las cuatro patas
inmóviles donde le daba la gana,<a name="FNanchor_7_1042" id="FNanchor_7_1042"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_1042" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> sin avanzar ni retroceder aunque le
destrozasen el hocico tirándole hacia adelante por la brida, o le
azotasen las ancas duramente por detrás;<a name="page_212" id="page_212"></a> no hacia más en tales casos
que balancear el cuerpo con dirección a la retaguardia, y estremecerse
de pies a cabeza<a name="FNanchor_8_1043" id="FNanchor_8_1043"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_1043" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> con temblor de pena y rabia al sentir el azote.
Otras veces metía la cabeza entre los cuartos delanteros<a name="FNanchor_9_1044" id="FNanchor_9_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_1044" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> y se daba
a<a name="FNanchor_10_1045" id="FNanchor_10_1045"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_1045" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> hacer corcovos tan altos, ondulados y bruscos, que no había jinete
que los resistiera.<a name="FNanchor_11_1046" id="FNanchor_11_1046"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_1046" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> O bien, asustándose de su propia sombra, saltaba

<p>Eran las nueve de la mañana cuando los peones apartaron las últimas
bolsas de nuestro trigo. La máquina paró y a la sombra de la parva
cercana la gente se dispuso a tomar el café; un sol fuerte nos ahogaba
tiñendo en llamaradas la campiña segada que parecía un inmenso cepillo
de oro.</p>

<p>Lejos, en el potrero, en las quebradas, en torno de las pequeñas
lagunas, los bueyes pacían, lentos y graves, en medio de la cháchara de

<p>El alcalde de la colonia,<a name="FNanchor_1_1048" id="FNanchor_1_1048"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1048" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> viejo de grandes barbas, elocuente<a name="page_213" id="page_213"></a> y
astuto, elegido por el vecindario en una asamblea efectuada en la
sinagoga, comentaba los resultados de la cosecha y alababa las calidades
de nuestro trigo.</p>

<p>Era analfabeto casi y sólo conocía por referencias<a name="FNanchor_2_1049" id="FNanchor_2_1049"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1049" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> ciertos pasajes de
la Escritura que citaba a menudo al intervenir en la entrega de una reja
o en la compra de un rollo de alambre.</p>

<p>Y aquella mañana cálida, rodeado por los vecinos, a la sombra de la
parva, peroraba sobre las ventajas de la vida rural.</p>

<p>&mdash;Bien sé yo&mdash;decía&mdash;que no estamos en Jerusalén: Bien sé yo que esta
tierra no es aquélla de nuestros antepasados. Pero, sembramos y tenemos
trigo, y de noche, cuando, regresamos de la era tras del arado podemos
bendecir al Altísimo porque nos ha conducido fuera de Rusia, donde
éramos odiados y vivíamos perseguidos y pobres.</p>

<p>El matarife replicó: El trigo de Besarabia es más blanco que el de la
colonia. Y expresó pausadamente su descontento.</p>

<p>&mdash;En Rusia&mdash;dijo&mdash;se vive mal, pero se teme a Dios y se vive de acuerdo
con su ley. Aquí los jóvenes se vuelven unos gauchos.</p>

<p>El agudo silbato de la máquina disolvió a los vecinos. Tocaba el turno a
las parvas de Moisés Hintler, quien permanecía silencioso junto a la
casilla rodante del maquinista. Era bajito, flaco, y sus ojos redondos y
diminutos traducían en su mirar de miope una alegría profunda. A su
lado, la mujer, envejecida en la miseria del pueblo natal, contemplaba
la faena y la hija Dvorah, moza robusta y ágil, preparaba el almuerzo.</p>

<p>Comenzó el trabajo. Subimos a la parva de Moisés para alcanzar las
gavillas y los peones engrasaban en tanto<a name="FNanchor_3_1050" id="FNanchor_3_1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1050" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> la máquina formidable.<a name="page_214" id="page_214"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;Moisés&mdash;exclamó el alcalde.&mdash;¿Tenías también parvas en Vilna? Allí
trabajabas de joyero y componías relojes, ganando un par de rublos al
mes. ¡Aquí, Moisés, tienes campo, trigo y ganado!</p>

<p>Levantó una copa de caña<a name="FNanchor_4_1051" id="FNanchor_4_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1051" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> y brindó:</p>

<p>&mdash;Moisés: Como decimos en Rusia, yo deseo que tu tierra sea siempre
fecunda y que por abundante,<a name="FNanchor_5_1052" id="FNanchor_5_1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1052" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> no logres juntar su fruto.</p>

<p>Moisés permaneció silencioso tras de la máquina. En su cabeza se
revolvían antiguos recuerdos de su vida lúgubre de Vilna, de su vida
martirizada y triste de judío.</p>

<p>La rueda mayor giró y el grano empezó a derramarse como lluvia de perlas
bajo la bíblica bendición del cielo inundado de luz. Interpuso
lentamente la mano sobre la cual el trigo caía en clara cascada, y así
la tuvo mucho tiempo. A su lado, la mujer miraba con avidez y Dvorah
miraba.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Veis, hijos míos? Este trigo es nuestro....</p>

<p>Y sobre sus mejillas aradas por una larga miseria, corrieron dos
lágrimas que cayeron junto con el grano en la primera bolsa de su
cosecha....</p>

<p>Pero lo que más amaba de su campo eran las <i>islas</i>, aquellas islas que,
como esquifes de verdura, se veían desde la cumbre de un cerro,
balanceando las copas frondosas y mojando los ramajes en la espuma.
Cuando el sol de la siesta sacaba al lagarto de su cueva y la víbora de
coral<a name="FNanchor_1_1053" id="FNanchor_1_1053"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1053" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> dormía enroscada cerca<a name="page_215" id="page_215"></a> del hormiguero, don Calixto, acostado
en el pasto, a la sombra que proyectaban los canelones y los molles,
tiraba su aparejo en la parte más honda del arroyo, en aquel pesquero
que tanto conocía y en donde abundaban la lisa begona, el surubí de
carne amarilla y el dorado de escamas relucientes. Mientras su pesca
aumentaba, los cardenales azules cantaban invisibles en el follaje la
melancólica romanza de los bosques, el martín pescador, de plumaje
tornasolado, volaba con rapidez a lo largo de la corriente, en busca de
su alimento acuático, los pino-limones desparramaban en torno suyo las
cuentas rojas de sus frutas maduras, y las campánulas moradas adornaban
los troncos, sobre la malla de las yedras siempre verdes.</p>

<p>Fué Tránsito quien se adelantó a recibirnos, notablemente pálida.</p>

<p>Y ayudado por su novia, se puso a desfruncir la mochila, diciéndole a la

<h4><a name="II-7" id="II-7"></a>7.&mdash;UNA BODEGA<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h4>

<p>Después de atravesar las ricas hectáreas de tierra donde las
plantaciones de vid forman líneas paralelas, entras en las bodegas. Allí
se pisa la uva y se deposita el mosto en barriles, para que fermente y
envejezca, hasta adquirir el preciado sabor y colorido del buen vino.
Las bodegas, en general, se construyen en lugares de quietud<a name="FNanchor_1_1064" id="FNanchor_1_1064"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1064" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> en
terrenos sanos, con dobles techos, dobles paredes y dobles puertas; son
de higiénica ventilación y los pisos como los muros se revocan con
morteros hidráulicos.</p>

<p>El departamento de las bodegas, parte capital del establecimiento,
comprende las secciones de elaboración, fermentación maquinaria,
depósito y tonelería. La bodega de elaboración está dotada de cierta
máquina, llamada demoledora, movida a vapor y colocada sobre un gran
tanque metálico, donde se mezcla y refrigera el mosto antes de ser
llevado, mediante una bomba<a name="page_218" id="page_218"></a> centrífuga, a la bodega de fermentación.
Ésta comprende para la fermentación del mosto, grandes piletas de
mampostería, provistas de sus respectivas compuertas y de un diafragma
para la sumersión del orujo, durante el proceso de fermentación. Cada
pileta está dotada de refrigerantes, unidos por un sistema completo de
cañerías, a la máquina refrigeradora, con el objeto de dominar
oportunamente las altas temperaturas que alcanzan en ese clima los
mostos en fermentación, asegurando de tal manera la marcha normal del
proceso, y, por consiguiente, la calidad de los vinos. En ciertas
bodegas de San Juan existen las más vastas, poderosas y completas
instalaciones frigoríficas que se aplican en el mundo entero a la
vinificación. Una bomba a vapor facilita el trasiego de los vinos nuevos
a la bodega de depósito. La bodega de depósito está a un nivel un poco
más bajo que el suelo; es semisubterránea. La singular disposición de
sus dobles techos y paredes, dotados los techos de poderosos
ventiladores, permiten mantener, aun en los días más ardientes del
verano, una temperatura muy baja. Completan las reparticiones
indispensables, vastos talleres mecánicos, herrería, carpintería, etc.,
para la fabricación y reparación de herramientas y maquinaria. Un
elegante «chalet» sirve de local a la administración. El establecimiento
representa un capital de varios millones de pesos.</p>

<p>La operación de la aparta se efectúa en un rodeo por la gente de a

corral a otro, y la restante es la que desempeña la ocupación activa del
trabajo. Para esto rodean los de a caballo a un grupo de animales y el
vaquero encargado de presidir la faena designa uno o varios de ese grupo
para ser apartados. Al instante dos o tres jinetes hienden el grupo que
entre todos han arrinconado en algún ángulo del corralón; colocan sus
cabalgaduras rozándose con un costado del animal, que por huir del que
se acerca, se abre paso entre los otros, y emprende una veloz carrera en
que el jinete le sigue, animándolo con la voz y sin apartarse una línea
hasta dejarlo en otro corral, cuya puerta despejan los que la ocupan
para dar paso al animal, volviendo a cerrarla inmediatamente. Pero
muchas veces el animal designado retrocede con velocidad en su carrera,
da precipitadas vueltas y «saca lances» imprevistos para libertarse de
la obstinada persecución del que lo sigue. Hay, pues, un gran peligro en
seguir al animal en estas diversas evoluciones caprichosas, que ponen en
dura prueba<a name="FNanchor_2_1066" id="FNanchor_2_1066"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1066" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> la destreza de los jinetes y el vigor y maestría de los
caballos. Para los <i>huasos</i>, el rodeo es un campo de batalla en que el
deber les manda desafiar los peligros; las caídas de algunos y aun la
muerte que suelen encontrar en esas caídas, no interrumpen ni modifican
el curso de la faena. El herido es transportado por los de a pie<a name="FNanchor_3_1067" id="FNanchor_3_1067"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1067" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
fuera del campo, y los demás continúan el trabajo, sin arredrarse ante

<h4><a name="II-11" id="II-11"></a>11.&mdash;LA BOLSA<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h4>

<p>De todos los sitios en que se forman agrupaciones humanas, ninguno
que<a name="FNanchor_1_1075" id="FNanchor_1_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1075" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> presente más ancho campo de observación al curioso que el salón
central de la Bolsa de Comercio. El traje nivelador<a name="FNanchor_2_1076" id="FNanchor_2_1076"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1076" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> le da, a primera
vista, cierto aspecto de homogeneidad que desaparece cuando la mirada
sagaz ahonda un poco en aquel mar revuelto en que se mezclan y confunden
todas las clases.</p>

<p>El fastuoso banquero, cuyo nombre sólo con ser mencionado<a name="FNanchor_3_1077" id="FNanchor_3_1077"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1077" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> hace
desfilar por la mente un mundo fantástico de millones, estrecha con su
mano pulida la grosera garra del chalán marrullero; el humilde
comisionista se codea familiarmente con el propietario acaudalado a
quien adula según las reglas de la democracia en boga; el mozalvete
recién iniciado en la turbulenta vida de los negocios pasea por todas
partes sus miradas<a name="FNanchor_4_1078" id="FNanchor_4_1078"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1078" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> codiciosas; el aventurero procaz roza el modesto
traje del simple dependiente con los estirados faldones de su levita
presuntuosa; el insular petimetre ostenta su bigote rizado a tijera<a name="FNanchor_5_1079" id="FNanchor_5_1079"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1079" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
bajo la mirada aguda del periodista burlón que prepara su crónica
sensacional, husmeando todas las conversaciones; el anciano enriquecido
por largos años de duro trabajo comenta, con la frialdad del egoísmo que
dan los años, esa crónica diaria de la<a name="page_223" id="page_223"></a> Bolsa, muchas de cuyas páginas
están escritas con sangre<a name="FNanchor_6_1080" id="FNanchor_6_1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_1080" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>; el usurero famélico gira y gira
describiendo círculos siniestros en torno de sus víctimas infelices.</p>

<p>El doctor se abrió paso como pudo<a name="FNanchor_7_1081" id="FNanchor_7_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_1081" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> hasta que consiguió llegar a la
reja que limita el recinto destinado a las operaciones, vulgo
«rueda.»<a name="FNanchor_8_1082" id="FNanchor_8_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_1082" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Agolpábase a aquella reja una multitud ansiosa, estremecida
por corrientes eléctricas. Se veían pescuezos estirados en angustiosa
espectativa, con la rigidez propia del jugador que espera la salida de
la carta que ha de decidir la partida; ojos desmesuradamente abiertos,
siguiendo con fijeza hipnótica los movimientos de la mano del apuntador,
el cual, subido sobre su tarima, anotaba las operaciones en las pizarras
que, negras, cuadradas, siniestras, se dibujaban como sombras en la
pared del fondo.</p>

<p>Salía de la «rueda» un estrepitoso vocerío, una algarabía de mil
demonios<a name="FNanchor_9_1083" id="FNanchor_9_1083"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_1083" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>: voces atipladas, roncas, sonoras, de tenor, de bajo, de
barítono; voces de todos los volúmenes y de todos los metales. Los
corredores parecían unos energúmenos; más tenían caras de hombres
enredados en una discusión de taberna, que de comerciantes en el acto de
realizar sus operaciones. Y no sólo gritaban como unos locos,<a name="FNanchor_10_1084" id="FNanchor_10_1084"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_1084" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> sino
que también gesticulaban y accionaban como si estuvieran por darse de
bofetadas.<a name="FNanchor_11_1085" id="FNanchor_11_1085"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_1085" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<h4><a name="II-12" id="II-12"></a>12.&mdash;EN DILIGENCIA<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h4>

<p>A las tres de la mañana llamó a la puerta de mi cuarto el mozo del hotel
con fuertes golpes y gritando con apremio<a name="FNanchor_1_1086" id="FNanchor_1_1086"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1086" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>:</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Ya es hora!<a name="FNanchor_2_1087" id="FNanchor_2_1087"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1087" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Echéme a cuestas<a name="FNanchor_3_1088" id="FNanchor_3_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1088" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> el vestido a toda prisa, entre grandes bostezos y
dándome al diablo<a name="FNanchor_4_1089" id="FNanchor_4_1089"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1089" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> porque el administrador de las diligencias hiciese
salir tan temprano el vehículo; y pocos momentos después abrí la puerta
de mi habitación, y me dirigí al comedor a tomar algún refrigerio.</p>

<p>Cuando bajé al zaguán, estaba listo el carruaje. Los tres tiros de mulas
hallábanse ya enganchados; el cochero ocupaba su puesto en el alto
pescante, y empuñaba con mano firme el abundante manojo de las mugrosas
riendas; el sota tenía por la brida el par de mulas delanteras para
impedir que partieran antes de tiempo; y dos mozos alumbraban la escena
con otras tantas gruesas y resinosas hachas, que despedían tanta luz
como chispas y espeso humo. Todavía salieron algunas maletas del
despacho del administrador, que fueron adicionadas a la henchida zaga o
al abultado techo del carruaje. La máquina estaba materialmente atestada
de carga: en la covacha, en el pescante, en la parte superior, en el
interior, debajo de los asientos, y aun en el espacio destinado a los
pies de los viajeros, por donde quiera<a name="FNanchor_5_1090" id="FNanchor_5_1090"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1090" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> había maletas. Concluidos los
preparativos,<a name="page_225" id="page_225"></a> llegó el momento de ocupar nuestros sitios, y lo hicimos
los pasajeros con resignación de mártires.</p>

<p>La diligencia se llenó en pocos momentos. ¡Éramos once pasajeros! Sólo
un asiento quedó desocupado en la banqueta de en medio, donde no hay más
apoyo para la espalda del paciente,<a name="FNanchor_6_1091" id="FNanchor_6_1091"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_1091" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> que una movible correa que
empuja, cede y aporrea como instrumento de inquisición. Afortunadamente
para mí, había podido escoger con tiempo un buen número en la banqueta
delantera, junto a la ventanilla; así es que relativamente quedé bien
instalado.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿No falta ningún<a name="FNanchor_7_1092" id="FNanchor_7_1092"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_1092" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> pasajero?&mdash;preguntó una voz en la puerta de la
posada.</p>

<p>&mdash;Ninguno,&mdash;repuso el sota.</p>

<p>No contento con<a name="FNanchor_8_1093" id="FNanchor_8_1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_1093" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> la respuesta, el administrador que era un español de
muy mal genio,<a name="FNanchor_9_1094" id="FNanchor_9_1094"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_1094" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> subió al estribo de la diligencia, y nos echó al
rostro la luz de la linterna que en la mano llevaba.</p>

<p>&mdash;Está bien&mdash;dijo bajando del estribo&mdash;¡en marcha<a name="FNanchor_10_1095" id="FNanchor_10_1095"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_1095" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>!</p>

<p>Sonaron las cadenas de los tiros, rechinó la pesada máquina, vaciló un
momento sobre las duras sopandas, hizo el cochero chasquear su látigo
descomunal y nos pusimos en movimiento. La diligencia salió con rapidez
vertiginosa, haciendo furioso estruendo en el empedrado, y turbando el
sueño de los buenos habitantes de Querétaro. Quien la hubiera visto
animada de aquella velocidad, habría creído que poca ventaja podría
sacarle<a name="page_226" id="page_226"></a> el vapor<a name="FNanchor_11_1096" id="FNanchor_11_1096"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_1096" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>; no así yo,<a name="FNanchor_12_1097" id="FNanchor_12_1097"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_1097" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> que estaba en el secreto,<a name="FNanchor_13_1098" id="FNanchor_13_1098"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_1098" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> y
sabía por experiencia que tales vehículos son rápidos en las poblaciones
y tardos en despoblado.</p>

<h4><a name="II-13" id="II-13"></a>13.&mdash;LA CAZA DE LAS VÁQUIRAS<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h4>

<p>&mdash;Mucho cuidado, señores&mdash;dijo Toribio, nuestro montero mayor,&mdash;porque
las váquiras<a name="FNanchor_1_1099" id="FNanchor_1_1099"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1099" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> están entiempadas ahora y son peligrosas.</p>

<p>Y empezó a colocarnos en nuestros puntos.</p>

<p>Las reses se bañaban en los charcos del quebradón y roznaban como si
todo el invierno estuviera allí: diríase que era un conciliábulo
patriótico de incondicionales que celebraban con el santo fin de<a name="FNanchor_2_1100" id="FNanchor_2_1100"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1100" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
repartirse la república.<a name="FNanchor_3_1101" id="FNanchor_3_1101"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1101" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Casiano había vuelto a tomar la escopeta y estaba en el fondo de la
quebrada, por el lado de abajo.</p>

<p>Toribio le había hecho aquella concesión por su extremada habilidad en
la cacería de váquiras.</p>

<p>Yo quedé cerca de él, dominándole desde un barranco y cubierto por un
chipio; y novicio en el tiro de váquiras, creí prudente sacar los
cartuchos de <i>guáimaros</i> y sustituirlos con balas rasas.<a name="page_227" id="page_227"></a></p>

<p>Los perros levantaron las piezas<a name="FNanchor_4_1102" id="FNanchor_4_1102"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1102" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> y comenzó el tiroteo en la parte de
arriba; y salidas las reses del lecho de la quebrada, se hubiera dado
por perdido el lance, si dos de ellas, macho y hembra, no hubiesen
corrido hacia abajo.</p>

<p>La posición que yo ocupaba no era muy ventajosa: pasaron por junto a
mí<a name="FNanchor_5_1103" id="FNanchor_5_1103"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1103" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> y no pude disparar; pero me acerqué a la quebrada y gané el cauce.</p>

<p>Casiano había disparado y errado el váquiro: hirió la hembra, y el
macho, como sucede en estos casos, se enfureció y le atacó.</p>

<p>Cuando yo doblé el recodo de la quebrada que me ocultaba los sucesos,
pude ver a Casiano luchando cuerpo a cuerpo<a name="FNanchor_6_1104" id="FNanchor_6_1104"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_1104" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> con el váquiro mientras
la otra<a name="FNanchor_7_1105" id="FNanchor_7_1105"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_1105" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> se revolcaba en su propia sangre.</p>

<p>El negro se defendía con el cañón de la escopeta, que despedía chispas
en los colmillos del cochino: la caja del fusil estaba hecha añicos.<a name="FNanchor_8_1106" id="FNanchor_8_1106"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_1106" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Pálido, ceniciento, se veía el negro entre el verde follaje de las
barrancas, bajo un toldo de ramas entrelazadas.</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Socorro, socorro!&mdash;gritaba....</p>

<p>El negro retrocedía pidiendo socorro, y el váquiro le cargaba.</p>

<p>Dió una embestida el animal y al saltar atrás el cazador se enredó en un
bejuco y cayó.</p>

<p>Un minuto más y<a name="FNanchor_9_1107" id="FNanchor_9_1107"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_1107" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> llevaríamos un cadáver.</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Ahora conmigo!<a name="FNanchor_10_1108" id="FNanchor_10_1108"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_1108" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>&mdash;grité, y el váquiro se volvió hacia mí.</p>

<p>Tenía los ojos inyectados y las encías hechas sangre.<a name="FNanchor_11_1109" id="FNanchor_11_1109"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_1109" class="fnanchor">[11]</a><a name="page_228" id="page_228"></a></p>

<p>Volví a gritarle y partió como una flecha: clavé la rodilla en el
fangoso lecho de la quebrada y le aguardé en la boca de mi escopeta.</p>

<p>Al ver el obstáculo que acababa de oponerle, erizó las cerdas y se
recogió para asaltarme; pero fué el último esfuerzo que tentó porque le
enterré la bala en el corazón.</p>

<p>Ya llegaban los otros. Pascual, estupefacto, me miraba desde el
barranco, con ojos desencajados.<a name="FNanchor_12_1110" id="FNanchor_12_1110"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_1110" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Toribio venía jadeante por el lecho
del arroyo, y Tigre, mi fiel Tigre, pasó rozándose conmigo y un instante
después destrozaba al váquiro agonizante.</p>

Este <i>batey</i> está compuesto de muchas y numerosas casas; semeja el

estar en Cuba para ver<a name="FNanchor_2_1112" id="FNanchor_2_1112"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1112" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> esta vegetación que lo limita y rodea. Detrás
de la cerca de limón, veo una ancha calle con doble fila de matas de

cafetos, cargados de blancas flores que imitan el azahar, cortados a la
misma altura y que devuelven hacia la tierra sus copiosas y redondas
ramas; sobresalen entre los cafetos las matas de plátanos, que con sus
hermosos racimos ofrecen abundoso alimento, regalo de una tierra
providencial. Cortan la finca en<a name="page_229" id="page_229"></a> secciones regulares espaciosas calles
de corpulentos frutales; veo el maíz, veo la yuca, veo cuanto forma<a name="FNanchor_4_1114" id="FNanchor_4_1114"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1114" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
una gran despensa, ante la cual la miseria cesa y la abundancia la
sustituye y la reemplaza. Y como si no fuese bastante el fruto de la
tierra, discurren por entre los cafetales bandadas de gallinas comunes y
de guinea, o pintadas, grandes perdices de este suelo privilegiado; los
ánades, patos y gansos forman en pos de ellas<a name="FNanchor_5_1115" id="FNanchor_5_1115"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1115" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> la pesada artillería de

<h4><a name="II-15" id="II-15"></a>15.&mdash;EN EL COMITÉ<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h4>

<p>Esa noche había gran asamblea.</p>

<p>El Comité hervía de gente<a name="FNanchor_1_1122" id="FNanchor_1_1122"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1122" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> de toda clase.&mdash;</p>

<p>Las piezas interiores estaban ocupadas por los personajes más
conspicuos;&mdash;los miembros de la comisión directiva, con cierto aire de
suficiencia y de unción que les venía de lo alto.</p>

<p>El secretario se había puesto su cuello más almidonado y una levita
negra que le daba por<a name="FNanchor_2_1123" id="FNanchor_2_1123"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1123" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> las pantorrillas; estaba embarazado con sus
faldones, que en cualquier movimiento se abrían como paracaídas; lucía
su mejor alfiler, y su anillo de chispa<a name="FNanchor_3_1124" id="FNanchor_3_1124"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1124" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> tenía un compañero tan ancho
que le impedía doblar el dedo.</p>

<p>Iba de un lado para otro, llevando papeles, entregando cartas y
notas&mdash;dando explicaciones,&mdash;escuchando pacientemente las preguntas que
le dirigían y sonriéndose con malicia con alguno de su confianza,<a name="FNanchor_4_1125" id="FNanchor_4_1125"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1125" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
cuando pasaba por delante de una serie de personajes adustos, graves,
que estaban sentados en hilera simétrica, en un rincón de la sala,
fumando con desahogo, hablándose a hurtadillas<a name="FNanchor_5_1126" id="FNanchor_5_1126"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1126" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> con monosílabos, y
dirigiendo de tiempo en tiempo sus ojos desconfiados a la puerta.</p>

<p>Tenían el aspecto venerable de los ancianos bíblicos.</p>

<p>La buena fe les hacía considerar el Comité como un templo; su actitud
era la de un testigo que espera la llegada del juez para prestar su
declaración.<a name="page_231" id="page_231"></a></p>

<p>Habían acudido al llamamiento, trayendo su contingente de influencia; en
cambio, habían abandonado su hogar y sus majadas<a name="FNanchor_6_1127" id="FNanchor_6_1127"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_1127" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> con la
despreocupación que les caracteriza.</p>

<p>El secretario aprovechaba la confusión para hacer sus excursiones al
fondo de la casa, en busca del fulano de los mates<a name="FNanchor_7_1128" id="FNanchor_7_1128"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_1128" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> que los tenía
cebados en hilera y por cuyas bombillas pasaba alternativamente sus
labios como quien<a name="FNanchor_8_1129" id="FNanchor_8_1129"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_1129" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> toca la zampoña; luego, limpiándose con la manga
del levitón, entraba más serio que un obispo en el salón de su
dependencia.</p>

<p>Un vocerío sordo y molesto llenaba todo el ambiente, especialmente en el
interior, donde se respiraba un aire denso y saturado de humo.</p>

<p>En los distintos corrillos que se habían formado, se hablaba en voz
alta, se discutía, se armaban apuestas y se ponderaban las virtudes y
los méritos de los ciudadanos inscriptos en las listas.&mdash;Eran todos la
flor y crema<a name="FNanchor_9_1130" id="FNanchor_9_1130"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_1130" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> del partido; ninguna tacha podía arrojárseles; en
cambio, a los que figuraban en la lista contraria, se les aplicaban los
dicterios más usuales del vocabulario callejero.<a name="FNanchor_10_1131" id="FNanchor_10_1131"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_1131" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Se les presentaba como a seres de otra especie.</p>

<p>Esos no querían la patria feliz, engrandecida, sino abierta por los
cuatro cantos para satisfacer sus ambiciones y su codicia.</p>

<p>Un extraño, al oirlo, habría creído que se trataba de enemigos feroces a
quienes era menester negarles el fuego y el agua.</p>

<h4><a name="II-16" id="II-16"></a>16.&mdash;VIAJANDO EN BUEY<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h4>

<p>&mdash;Ya está listo su buey para subir a la Nevada, me dijo el guía. Estas
palabras me hicieron comprender que me era preciso ensayar, en un camino
pésimo, un nuevo elemento de transporte. Sí, hasta la fecha había yo
viajado en la mula del fraile,<a name="FNanchor_1_1132" id="FNanchor_1_1132"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1132" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> o sea a pie, en burro, en mulo,<a name="FNanchor_2_1133" id="FNanchor_2_1133"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1133" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> a
caballo, en carro, en coche, en tren, en bote, en goleta, en bergantín,
en vapor de río, en vapor de mar; pero no me había pasado nunca por la
cabeza<a name="FNanchor_3_1134" id="FNanchor_3_1134"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1134" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> tener que viajar en... buey. Me pareció algo ridículo y
depresivo, pero me di<a name="FNanchor_4_1135" id="FNanchor_4_1135"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1135" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> como excusa para resignarme el que los egipcios
no se creyeron deshonrados por adorar al insigne Apis, y que además no
estaba el camino de la Sierra, después de un invierno feroz,<a name="FNanchor_5_1136" id="FNanchor_5_1136"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1136" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> para
hacer la gracia de<a name="FNanchor_6_1137" id="FNanchor_6_1137"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_1137" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> subirlo a pie, ni siquiera en mula. El guía me dió
algunas explicaciones para mi gobierno.<a name="FNanchor_7_1138" id="FNanchor_7_1138"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_1138" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Lo que en el buey sirve de
bozal y de freno es un hico que se amarra a la argolla de hierro que se
le pone en la nariz al pobre animal. Cuando se quiere arrendar a la
derecha, se pasa el hico por sobre el cuerno derecho, y cuando a la
izquierda, por sobre el cuerno izquierdo. La cincha debe estar muy
tensa, porque el animal tiene el lomo muy movedizo. Regularmente se le
monta en angarilla, pero hasta allí no llegó mi filosofía, y le hice
poner una silla de fuste alto y fuerte.<a name="page_233" id="page_233"></a></p>

<p><i>Calzón</i>, el gran <i>Calzón</i>, mi bagaje, era un buey potente, pero el más
flemático, testarudo y lerdo que jamás<a name="FNanchor_8_1139" id="FNanchor_8_1139"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_1139" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> rumió ricos pastos en las
dehesas de la Sierra. Era imposible sacarlo de su andar lento y
acompasado. En balde<a name="FNanchor_9_1140" id="FNanchor_9_1140"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_1140" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> resultaron los golpes aplicados con el talón y
los garrotazos dados en el pescuezo. Positivamente deploré no haberme
calzado mis espuelas para poder rasgarle los ijares al perezoso animal.
Tuve al fin que dejarlo andar a su gusto, estimulándolo de vez en cuando
con el grito de ¡buey! lanzado guturalmente, a usanza <i>arhuaca</i>.</p>

<p>A eso de<a name="FNanchor_1_1141" id="FNanchor_1_1141"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1141" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> la una de la madrugada, el velorio está en su punto.<a name="FNanchor_2_1142" id="FNanchor_2_1142"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1142" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Tres
o cuatro jóvenes, en la puerta de la calle, charlan, disputan, manotean,
y hasta lanzan alguna pedrada a un gato, que tiene la mala ocurrencia de
dejarse ver por aquellos contornos; y al cual, le aciertan casualmente,
causando esto sumo regocijo al grupo, que no sabe cómo celebrar el tino
del que tan flaco servicio<a name="FNanchor_3_1143" id="FNanchor_3_1143"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1143" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> le acaba de hacer al micho.</p>

<p>Luego se llega al capítulo de las travesuras y de las maldades, con los
que se rinden al sueño; y hay aquello de<a name="FNanchor_4_1144" id="FNanchor_4_1144"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1144" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> pintorrear con un corcho
quemado, al que duerme en un rincón y ronca estrepitosamente. Las
risotadas empiezan a ser ruidosas, sobre todo, cuando a otro que se ha
quedado dormido con la boca<a name="page_234" id="page_234"></a> abierta, le introducen en ella un cabo de
tabaco, sin que lo sienta la víctima de <i>la maldad</i>; o bien cuando le
ponen un enorme sombrero de tres picos,<a name="FNanchor_5_1145" id="FNanchor_5_1145"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1145" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> hecho de un periódico o, lo

<p>Una vez que se reponen, conocida y hasta celebrada la causa de la
sorpresa que han experimentado, para hallar entonces motivo de charla,
porque las mujeres no callan sino cuando duermen, si bien las hay que
hasta hablan en sueños, pregunta una la hora que es; otra añade que

<p>Positivamente, el que quiera ver y estudiar un cuadro auténtico de la
vida mejicana, el que quiera conocer una de las tradiciones más
constantes de nuestro pueblo, no tiene más que<a name="FNanchor_2_1154" id="FNanchor_2_1154"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1154" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> tomar un coche del
ferrocarril urbano que sale de la Plaza de Armas cada diez minutos,
conduciendo a la Villa una catarata de gente que se desparrama de los
veinte wagones que constituyen cada tren, al llegar a la Villa de
Guadalupe. Es la ciudad entera de Méjico que se traslada al pie del
Santuario, desde la mañana hasta la tarde, formando una muchedumbre
confusa, revuelta, abigarrada, pintoresca, pero difícil de describir.</p>

<p>Allí están todas las razas de la antigua colonia, todas las clases de la
nueva república, todas las castas que viven en nuestra democracia, todos
los trajes de nuestra civilización, todas las opiniones de nuestra
política, todas las variedades del vicio y todas las máscaras de la
virtud, en Méjico.</p>

<p>Nadie se exceptúa y nadie se distingue: es la igualdad ante la virgen;
es la idolatría nacional.</p>

<p>Allí se codea la dama encopetada, de mantilla española o de velo de
Chantilly, que estamos acostumbrados a ver balanceándose sobre sus altos
tacones en las calles de Plateros, con la india enredada de Cuautitlán o
de Atzcapotzalco; allí se confunde cubierto de polvo, el joven elegante
de cuello abierto, de pantalón <i>à la patte d&rsquo;éléphant</i> que luce sus
atractivos femeniles en el Zócalo, con el tosco y barbudo arriero de
Ixmiquilpan o con el indio medio desnudo de las comarcas de Texcoco, de
Ecatepec y de Zumpango, o con el sucio lépero de la Palma o de<a name="page_236" id="page_236"></a> Santa
Ana. Y no existen allí las consideraciones sociales; los carruajes de
los ricos se detienen a orillas del pueblo, lo mismo que los coches
simones, lo mismo que los trenes del ferrocarril. Todo el mundo se apea
y se confunde entre la multitud; el millonario va expuesto a ser
pisoteado por el pordiosero y despojado de su reloj por el pillo. La
señorona estruja sus vestidos de seda con los inmundos arambeles de la
mendiga y con las calzoneras de cuero del peregrino de tierra
adentro.<a name="FNanchor_3_1155" id="FNanchor_3_1155"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1155" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> No se puede entrar en el santuario sino a empellones<a name="FNanchor_4_1156" id="FNanchor_4_1156"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1156" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>; no
se puede circular por la placita sino dejándose arrastrar por una
corriente inevitable.</p>

<p>En los días subsiguientes, la ciudad santa de Guadalupe que, como todas
las ciudades santas y focos de<a name="FNanchor_5_1157" id="FNanchor_5_1157"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1157" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> devoción, es un lugarejo triste y
desolado, no presenta de notable más que el inmenso basurero en que la
deja convertida la devoción de los fieles mejicanos.</p>

acostumbrado a tan rabiosos manjares.<a name="page_237" id="page_237"></a> Son platos fuertes, muy fuertes,
hechos de carne, pollo, perdiz, boga y papas. De ahí que para placar los
furores del ají (pimiento picante) se beba mucha chicha. Por esto los
bolivianos de la altiplanicie son tan famosos bebedores.</p>

<h4><a name="II-20" id="II-20"></a>20.&mdash;EL MATE<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h4>

<p>Aunque el arte de hacer una buena taza de té es algo sagrado, que sólo
lo hace la dueña de casa<a name="FNanchor_1_1161" id="FNanchor_1_1161"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1161" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> en una familia inglesa, el cebar mate<a name="FNanchor_2_1162" id="FNanchor_2_1162"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1162" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
bien es aún más difícil y en algunas familias antiguas sólo lo hacían
sirvientes especiales llamadas cebadoras de mate. La palabra cebar nos
expresa además la idea de mantener, alimentar, sustentar algo en estado
floreciente. Se quiere indicar con la frase «cebar mate,» no el acto de
llenar el mate con agua caliente, sino mantener ese mate en condiciones
siempre apetitosas. Es una función tan sagrada como la de las mismas
Vestales para algunos <i>materos</i> intransigentes....</p>

<p>El mate debe ser tomado caliente; sólo así es agradable al paladar; en
estas condiciones el agua disuelve mayor cantidad de los principios
solubles de la yerba, entre los cuales los hay<a name="page_238" id="page_238"></a> aromáticos, que dan
sabor agradable a la infusión. No debe ser bebido, sin embargo,
demasiado caliente, pelando, como se dice vulgarmente: en estas
condiciones el mate es desagradable y la cebadura queda inutilizada; lo
que se expresa diciendo que la «yerba se ha quemado».</p>

<p>Igualmente el mate frío, es decir, tibio, es detestable, sólo sirve para
producir dolores de vientre.<a name="FNanchor_3_1163" id="FNanchor_3_1163"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1163" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Sin embargo, la misma yerba puesta en maceración con agua fría, nos da
una bebida agradable que no tiene los inconvenientes del mate frío y que
lleva el nombre de <i>tererere</i>.</p>

<p>Si cebar mate es difícil, no lo es menos<a name="FNanchor_4_1164" id="FNanchor_4_1164"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1164" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> saberlo tomar con la
compostura debida.</p>

<p>El que no sabe tomar mate, el chambón, se conoce a la legua<a name="FNanchor_5_1165" id="FNanchor_5_1165"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1165" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>; toma el
mate de una manera tal, que si los franceses conocieran la estética del
<i>matero</i> clasificarían de <i>gauche</i>; inclina demasiado la cabeza como si
se fuera a tragar la bombilla o a comerse el mate: Los carrillos se
deprimen en virtud de la presión atmosférica y arruga la cara de tal
manera que<a name="FNanchor_6_1166" id="FNanchor_6_1166"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_1166" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> causa espanto. Los ojos se salen de sus órbitas, como si
tratara de buscar una moneda caída en una laguna; inclina el cuerpo y
hace contorsiones tales, como si hubiese tragado una espina. Espectáculo
horrendo que conmueve las fibras más sensibles<a name="FNanchor_7_1167" id="FNanchor_7_1167"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_1167" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> de un espectador de

<p>CRÓNICA DE LA ÉPOCA DEL VIRREY INGLÉS</p>

<p>Aquella noche quiso su excelencia<a name="FNanchor_2_1169" id="FNanchor_2_1169"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1169" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> convencerse personalmente de la
manera como se obedecían sus prescripciones. Después de las once, y
cuando estaba la ciudad en plena<a name="FNanchor_3_1170" id="FNanchor_3_1170"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1170" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> tiniebla, embozóse el virrey en su
capa y salió de Palacio.<a name="FNanchor_4_1171" id="FNanchor_4_1171"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1171" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>A poco andar<a name="FNanchor_5_1172" id="FNanchor_5_1172"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1172" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> tropezó con una ronda; mas reconociéndolo el capitán, lo
dejó seguir tranquilamente, murmurando:&mdash;Vamos, ya pareció aquéllo<a name="FNanchor_6_1173" id="FNanchor_6_1173"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_1173" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>!
También su excelencia anda de galanteo<a name="FNanchor_7_1174" id="FNanchor_7_1174"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_1174" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> y por eso no quiere que los
demás tengan un arreglillo y se diviertan.</p>

<p>Y el virrey encontró otras tres rondas, y los capitanes le dieron las
buenas noches,<a name="FNanchor_8_1175" id="FNanchor_8_1175"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_1175" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> y le preguntaron si quería ser acompañado y se
derritieron en cortesías, y le dejaron libre el paso.</p>

<p>Sonaron las dos y el virrey, cansado del ejercicio, se retiraba ya a
dormir, cuando le dió en la cara la luz del farolillo de la quinta
ronda, cuyo capitán era Juan Pedro Lostaunau.</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Alto! ¿Quién vive?<a name="FNanchor_9_1176" id="FNanchor_9_1176"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_1176" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>&mdash;Soy yo, Juan Pedro, el virrey.<a name="page_240" id="page_240"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;No conozco al virrey en la calle, después de las diez de la noche. ¡Al
cuartel el vagabundo<a name="FNanchor_10_1177" id="FNanchor_10_1177"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_1177" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>!</p>

<p>&mdash;Pero, señor capitán....</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Nada! El bando es bando<a name="FNanchor_11_1178" id="FNanchor_11_1178"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_1178" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> y, ¡a la cárcel todo Cristo<a name="FNanchor_12_1179" id="FNanchor_12_1179"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_1179" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>!</p>

<p>Al siguiente día quedaron destituidos de sus empleos los cuatro
capitanes, que por respeto<a name="FNanchor_13_1180" id="FNanchor_13_1180"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_1180" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> no habían arrestado al virrey, y los que
los reemplazaron fueron bastante enérgicos para no andarse en
contemplaciones,<a name="FNanchor_14_1181" id="FNanchor_14_1181"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_1181" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> poniendo en breve término a los desórdenes.</p>

<p>El hecho es que pasó la noche<a name="FNanchor_15_1182" id="FNanchor_15_1182"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_1182" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> en el calabozo de la cárcel de la

<p>Pero, me diréis, ¿los bogotanos no pasean, no tienen un punto de
reunión, un club, una calle predilecta, algo como los bulevares, nuestra
calle Florida,<a name="FNanchor_1_1198" id="FNanchor_1_1198"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1198" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> el Ringstrasse de Viena, el Unter den Linden de
Berlín, El Corso de Roma, el Broadway de New York, o el Park Lane de
Londres? Sí, pero todo en uno: tienen el Altozano. Altozano es una
palabra bogotana para designar simplemente el alto de la catedral, que
ocupa todo un lado de la plaza Bolívar, colocado sobre cinco o seis
gradas, y de un ancho de diez a quince metros. Allí por la mañana,
tomando el sol,<a name="FNanchor_2_1199" id="FNanchor_2_1199"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1199" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> cuyo ardor mitiga la fresca atmósfera de la altura, y

come a las cuatro), todo cuanto la ciudad tiene de notable<a name="FNanchor_3_1200" id="FNanchor_3_1200"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1200" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> en

mundo se pasea de lado a lado. Una bolsa, un círculo literario, un
areópago, una <i>coterie</i>, un salón de solterones, una <i>coulisse</i> de
teatro, un forum, toda la actividad de Bogotá en un centenar de metros

<h4><a name="II-24" id="II-24"></a>24.&mdash;EL BAUTIZO<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h4>

<p>Las costumbres sencillas van degenerando poco a poco. Antes daba
gusto<a name="FNanchor_1_1205" id="FNanchor_1_1205"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1205" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> bautizar a un chiquillo de uno u otro sexo, porque se celebraba
el acto como si fuera el santo del patrono de un pueblo.<a name="FNanchor_2_1206" id="FNanchor_2_1206"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1206" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Se invitaban
a las familias amigas y a los jóvenes habilidosos capaces de recitar una
oda si a mano viene<a name="FNanchor_3_1207" id="FNanchor_3_1207"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1207" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>; se repartían<a name="page_244" id="page_244"></a> monedas en cintas o en
cartulinas<a name="FNanchor_4_1208" id="FNanchor_4_1208"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1208" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> y se bailaba. En fin, el día del bautizo era un día
grande.<a name="FNanchor_5_1209" id="FNanchor_5_1209"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1209" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Por eso decía un dentista, ahora años, que «el nacimiento de
un niño en Cuba es un hecho altamente significativo».</p>

<p>Y así debía ser, porque el niño dejaba de ser judío para convertirse en
cristiano.<a name="FNanchor_6_1210" id="FNanchor_6_1210"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_1210" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Se le borraba el pecado original<a name="FNanchor_7_1211" id="FNanchor_7_1211"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_1211" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> con un poco de agua,
sal y aceite, como si se tratara de preparar una lechuga. El héroe en
general, preso entre tanta faja,<a name="FNanchor_8_1212" id="FNanchor_8_1212"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_1212" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> encajes y faldellín, lloraba en
cuanto sentía que el cura le echaba la sal en la boca y se dormía en
cuanto llegaba de la iglesia, y la madrina le decía a su madre: «Usted
me lo entregó judío y se lo devuelvo cristiano». Y mientras el chico
dormía a pierna suelta<a name="FNanchor_9_1213" id="FNanchor_9_1213"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_1213" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> en su cama después de haber recibido algunos
besos de los concurrentes, empezaban a bailar en la sala y a tomar
dulces y helados.</p>

<p>Después que uno es grandecito y piensa en estas cosas le entra a uno
cierto desconsuelo porque eso de que<a name="FNanchor_10_1214" id="FNanchor_10_1214"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_1214" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> por uno tomen helados, licores
y dulces los demás mientras que el héroe si acaso<a name="FNanchor_11_1215" id="FNanchor_11_1215"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_1215" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> chupaba el dedo de
la criandera, es cosa triste.</p>

<p>Yo no sé cuantas cintas de bautizo (sin monedas) guardo<a name="page_245" id="page_245"></a> desde que
asistí a tomar la cerveza cada vez que cristianaban a un semejante. Y
nadie sabe lo que me recrea registrar estas reliquias como yo las llamo.
En la manera de doblar las cintas estriba uno de los mayores atractivos.
Parecían condecoraciones de una legión cualquiera.</p>

<p>Pero hoy con el Registro Civil<a name="FNanchor_12_1216" id="FNanchor_12_1216"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_1216" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> el bautizo va perdiendo su
importancia por más que<a name="FNanchor_13_1217" id="FNanchor_13_1217"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_1217" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> todavía hoy sirve para borrar el pecado
original, pero ya no es lo que era antes. Hoy los bautizos apenas se
celebran. Unos dicen que es por la situación del país, pero es porque la
religión va perdiendo terreno.<a name="FNanchor_14_1218" id="FNanchor_14_1218"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_1218" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

jugadores de alto tono,<a name="FNanchor_3_1221" id="FNanchor_3_1221"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1221" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> la juventud dorada<a name="FNanchor_4_1222" id="FNanchor_4_1222"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1222" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> de Montevideo,<a name="page_246" id="page_246"></a> que
salía a jugar por lo fino,<a name="FNanchor_5_1223" id="FNanchor_5_1223"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1223" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> con cáscaras de cera y cartuchos de
confites. Era de verlos, tan ufanos y alegres, con sus garibaldinas
azules o rojas, pantalón blanco, bota de charol a la granadera,<a name="FNanchor_6_1224" id="FNanchor_6_1224"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_1224" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
lujosa faja de seda, y en la cabeza una boina graciosamente achatada
hacia un lado.</p>

<p>Allí era el<a name="FNanchor_7_1225" id="FNanchor_7_1225"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_1225" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> salir apresuradamente las señoritas a los balcones,
armadas de sus jarros, echando agua con una mano sobre aquellos
peripuestos donceles, y defendiéndose con la otra de los proyectiles que
ellos les arrojaban, con toda mesura,<a name="FNanchor_8_1226" id="FNanchor_8_1226"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_1226" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> a barajar, para no<a name="FNanchor_9_1227" id="FNanchor_9_1227"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_1227" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
lastimarlas.</p>

<p>&mdash;Acérquese, pues, no sea cobarde, decía una dirigiéndose a alguno de
los campeones.</p>

<p>&mdash;Me acercaré si usted me tira esa flor que tiene en la cabeza.</p>

<p>&mdash;Allá va,<a name="FNanchor_10_1228" id="FNanchor_10_1228"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_1228" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> venga a recogerla.</p>

<p>Caía la flor bajo los balcones, apresurábase el caballero a levantarla,
y cuando con una amable sonrisa iba a saludar a la dueña, recibía en el
rostro un torrente de agua que le enceguecía y ahogaba, desgracia que él
trataba de disimular diciendo con toda galantería:</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Cómo ha de ser<a name="FNanchor_11_1229" id="FNanchor_11_1229"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_1229" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>! No hay rosa sin espinas ....</p>

<p>Y así seguía el juego por largo rato, ellos aguantando un diluvio de
agua que los dejaba ensopados, y ellas recibiendo los huevos de cera,
que se estrellaban en sus manos, perfumándolas con esquisitas esencias,
no sin que<a name="FNanchor_12_1230" id="FNanchor_12_1230"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_1230" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> de vez en cuando se oyese a alguna gritar:<a name="page_247" id="page_247"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;¡Puf! Está podrido.</p>

<p>Cuando ambos beligerantes quedaban ya rendidos de la refriega, empezaba
la parte galante de la fiesta. Los caballeros arrojaban a manos
llenas<a name="FNanchor_13_1231" id="FNanchor_13_1231"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_1231" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> cartuchos de confites, y ahí era el gritar y manotear de los
chicuelos, que estaban a<a name="FNanchor_14_1232" id="FNanchor_14_1232"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_1232" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> los desperdicios, lanzándose en masa sobre
la vereda cuando algún cartucho no llegaba a su destino, empujándose,
pateándose por agarrar la codiciada presa, mientras los jugadores hacían
toda clase de esfuerzos para barajar las coronas que en cambio de los
confites les llovían, retribuyendo ellos todavía el obsequio con cajas
especiales, de antemano destinadas a fulana y a zutana, a quienes las
enviaban por medio de sus sirvientes, no atreviéndose a correr el albur
de que<a name="FNanchor_15_1233" id="FNanchor_15_1233"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_1233" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> al arrojarlas cayesen entre la turba multa<a name="FNanchor_16_1234" id="FNanchor_16_1234"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_1234" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> de arrapiezos
que andaban a caza de<a name="FNanchor_17_1235" id="FNanchor_17_1235"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_1235" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> gangas.</p>

<p>Muchas veces, cuando las heroínas estaban ya muy tranquilas haciendo el
recuento de los regalos y narrando los episodios del combate, se veían
de repente sorprendidas, invadidas por un grupo de intrépidos que iban a
librarles batalla<a name="FNanchor_18_1236" id="FNanchor_18_1236"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_1236" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> dentro de sus propias trincheras. Gritos,
cerramientos estrepitosos de puertas, vidrios rotos, repliegues de las
jugadoras a un rincón, y protestas de los dueños de la casa,&mdash;tal era el
comienzo de la lucha. El campo de batalla era la sala prudentemente
desamueblada desde el día anterior, sin alfombra, sin cortinas, sin
ningún adorno, en fin, más que la gran tina del baño<a name="FNanchor_19_1237" id="FNanchor_19_1237"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_1237" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> colmada de
agua, el baño de asiento,<a name="FNanchor_20_1238" id="FNanchor_20_1238"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_1238" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> la tinaja, los tachos grandes de la
cocina, y todo cuanto cacharro pudiera servir para tener mucha agua a
mano.<a name="page_248" id="page_248"></a></p>

<p>Repuestas las niñas del susto, emprendían el ataque provistas de sus
jarros, pues buen cuidado tenían de no dejar sus armas para que el
enemigo las aprovechase. Defendíanse los hombres como podían, con las
manos, con los sombreros, con lo que les caía al alcance, pero
generalmente acababan por quedar vencidos, porque es irresistible una
carga de jugadoras de ésas que se calientan en la refriega y ya no miran
para atrás,<a name="FNanchor_21_1239" id="FNanchor_21_1239"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_1239" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> arrojando agua mientras tienen agua, y concluyendo a
jarrazo limpio<a name="FNanchor_22_1240" id="FNanchor_22_1240"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_1240" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> cuando ya no tienen con qué mojar. Escurríanse los
asaltantes como podían, perseguidos hasta en la escalera, por la
servidumbre que hacía de reserva a las patronas; pero frecuentemente
sucedía que el menos listo o el más aturdido quedaba solo, encerrado
dentro de un círculo femenino que, no por serlo, era menos terrible, y
entonces pagaba él la calaverada por él, y por sus compañeros. Ésta le
aturde con un jarro de agua en los ojos, aquélla le aplasta
encasquetándole un balde lleno en la cabeza, la otra le pellizca de un
brazo, tironéale la de más allá de las orejas, hasta que, entusiasmadas
de veras,<a name="FNanchor_23_1241" id="FNanchor_23_1241"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_1241" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> cargan las cuatro con él, y a pesar de sus manotadas y
pataleos, le zambullen dentro de la tina, y de buena gana le ahogarían,
si la oportuna intervención del dueño de la casa, no pusiese fin a la
gresca. ¡Cómo saldría de mohino y cariacontecido el zarandeado
asaltante, es cosa que ya el lector sobradamente se imaginará ....!</p>

skirmishes took place in the streets between young men and women, in
which they squirted water or perfume at each other. Besides the ordinary
receptacles for holding liquids, a variety of syringes and rubber bulbs
were manufactured for use during these contests. Particularly popular in
former days was the <i>pomo</i>, a tube almost exactly like the tubes used
to-day as containers for tooth-paste. The &ldquo;eggs&rdquo; mentioned by the author
were of wax, and filled with water. Real eggs, however, were sometimes
used. In the large cities, squirting water was forbidden about twenty
years ago, but the custom still persists in the country districts.</p></div>

<h4><a name="II-26" id="II-26"></a>26.&mdash;EL LUTO<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h4>

<p>Ya han pasado dos meses y las niñas están cansadas del encierro, y abren
algún tanto y por un momento, un postigo, para ver <i>algo</i> de la calle y
oír el órgano que toca en la esquina o en otra parte.</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Qué bonita danza, Luisa!</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Qué bonita!</p>

<p>Y abrazada una hermana a la cintura de la otra, principian <i>un cedazo</i>.</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Niñas, por Dios!&mdash;grita su madre.&mdash;Todavía no es tiempo.</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Maldito luto<a name="FNanchor_1_1242" id="FNanchor_1_1242"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1242" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>!&mdash;dice Luisa.</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Maldito!&mdash;contesta Elena.</p>

<p>En estos momentos entra Da. Emelina, la vecina de al lado,<a name="FNanchor_2_1243" id="FNanchor_2_1243"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1243" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> que tiene
reunión en su casa con motivo del bautismo de un niño.</p>

<p>&mdash;Vecina,&mdash;le dice a la madre de las niñas,&mdash;traigo <i>un empeño</i> con
usted.</p>

<p>&mdash;Si está en mi mano<a name="FNanchor_3_1244" id="FNanchor_3_1244"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1244" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> ....</p>

<p>&mdash;Ya lo creo; esta tarde se bautiza mi nietecito y es preciso que Luisa
y Elena vayan a divertirse un rato ....</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Imposible, <i>el luto</i>!</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Y van a morirse las pobres niñas de tristeza? ¿Hasta cuándo han de
sufrir? Es preciso, vecina, que considere usted<a name="page_250" id="page_250"></a> que son jóvenes, y que
todo no ha de ser penas<a name="FNanchor_4_1245" id="FNanchor_4_1245"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1245" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> en este mundo; además, en casa no hay más que
una reunión amistosa, de familia; algunas muchachas del barrio y nada
más. Se bailará con la música del piano y se cantará, por jóvenes
decentes,<a name="FNanchor_5_1246" id="FNanchor_5_1246"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1246" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> alguna cosita. ¿Qué tiene eso de particular?</p>

<p>&mdash;Es verdad Da. Emelina, pero <i>el luto</i> ....</p>

<p>&mdash;¡El luto! ¡El luto!&mdash;¿Qué tiene que ver el luto? Además las niñas no
van a bailar ni a cantar.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Qué dirán los que las vean?</p>

<p>&mdash;Eso tiene remedio; estarán ocultas en el primer cuarto y desde allí lo
verán todo. ¡Pobrecitas!</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Y los de la calle que las vean pasar a su casa, Da. Emelina?</p>

<p>&mdash;Eso también tiene remedio: que se vistan<a name="FNanchor_6_1247" id="FNanchor_6_1247"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_1247" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> ahora que es medio día,<a name="FNanchor_7_1248" id="FNanchor_7_1248"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_1248" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
y nadie las vé ....</p>

<p>&mdash;Sí, mamá&mdash;dice Elena.</p>

<p>&mdash;Sí, mamá&mdash;dice Luisa.</p>

<p>&mdash;Y usted también va, vecina&mdash;añade Da. Emelina a la viuda.</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Yo!&mdash;exclama ésta admirada&mdash;las niñas, pase,<a name="FNanchor_8_1249" id="FNanchor_8_1249"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_1249" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> que al fin son
jóvenes, pero ... ¿yo? ... ¡Qué locura!</p>

<p>&mdash;Mamá, si tú no vas, yo tampoco,&mdash;dice Luisa.</p>

<p>&mdash;Ni yo tampoco&mdash;agrega Elena.</p>

<p>&mdash;No tienen ustedes más que vestirse de blanco y echarse un pañuelo
negro por los hombros&mdash;propuso Da. Emelina.</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Eso no!&mdash;esclaman todas&mdash;de luto riguroso,<a name="FNanchor_9_1250" id="FNanchor_9_1250"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_1250" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> todavía no es tiempo
para otra ropa.<a name="page_251" id="page_251"></a></p>

<p>&mdash;Como quieran, contesta Da. Emelina&mdash;pero pronto, vamos pronto, a comer
en casa, de modo que ya estén ustedes allá antes del bautismo.</p>

<p>Y se visten de luto riguroso y de una carrerita<a name="FNanchor_10_1251" id="FNanchor_10_1251"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_1251" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> pasan a casa de la
vecina, no sin advertir antes a los criados que tengan buen cuidado
de<a name="FNanchor_11_1252" id="FNanchor_11_1252"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_1252" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> no abrir los postigos de la ventana, y que no canten ni permitan
ruido.</p>

<p>&mdash;¿Qué es éso? les pregunta en la calle un amigo importuno, señalándoles
el traje.</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Mi pobre Juan!&mdash;contesta la viuda.</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Mi papaíto!&mdash;añade Elena.</p>

<p>&mdash;¡Mi padrecito!&mdash;exclama Luisa.</p>

<p>&mdash;Pues <i>las acompaño en su sentimiento</i>,<a name="FNanchor_12_1253" id="FNanchor_12_1253"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_1253" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> dice el importuno,

<p>Para apreciar el bambuco debidamente, es menester oírlo en instrumentos
de cuerda<a name="FNanchor_1_1254" id="FNanchor_1_1254"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1254" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>: bandola, tiple y guitarra, y si a esto se le agrega
pandereta y chucho, el efecto es irresistible. Este último instrumento
consiste en una caña delgada de guadua, de cuarenta y cinco centímetros
de longitud, cerrada en sus extremos con pergamino y unos cuantos granos
de maíz, adentro. Produce un sonido seco y nervioso, y sirve para marcar
el compás.<a name="page_252" id="page_252"></a></p>

<p>Hacia un lado del espacio libre que servía de salón, colocáronse una
docena de muchachas guapísimas; eran las parejas.</p>

<p>En esto se adelantó uno de los mozos, se dirigió a una de ellas, y a
guisa de invitación hízole una Ligera venia.</p>

<p>¡Qué hermoso par de figuras! Él, fuerte, musculoso, de modales
desembarazados como todos los habitantes de las tierras cálidas<a name="FNanchor_2_1255" id="FNanchor_2_1255"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1255" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>;
ella, garbosa y elástica, el pecho mórbido, el talle cimbrador, morena
como andaluza, de mejillas frescas y ojos negros.</p>

<p>La muchacha, con un brazo en jarras,<a name="FNanchor_3_1256" id="FNanchor_3_1256"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1256" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> caído el otro sosteniendo la
falda, avanzó sonriente y magnífica, y se detuvo. El galán se apartó, y
entonces empezaron verdaderamente los movimientos vivos y agitados de
esta danza.</p>

<p>Principia el hombre con un paseo hacia la pareja, como para invitarla;
ella cede y le sigue; y así a los manejos de la música, ejecutan varias
figuras en que, ya se retiran desdeñosos, ya se buscan y se acercan;
pero al tiempo de encontrarse la mujer da una media vuelta<a name="FNanchor_4_1257" id="FNanchor_4_1257"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1257" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> y huye.
Entonces el hombre la sigue siempre, hasta que, después de un zapateo
final se retiran, y una nueva pareja ocupa el puesto.</p>

<p>En los hogares del pobre, en las calles y plazas de mi pueblo, en los
senderos que conducen a la huerta y a la montaña, hay,<a name="page_253" id="page_253"></a> antes de llegar
el día de Muertos, un movimiento inusitado y extraordinario: Diríase que
se prepara una gran fiesta en la cual deben tomar parte todos los
corazones. Por dondequiera se ven ramos y coronas de flores, cirios de
blanquísima cera, tiendecillas donde se venden frutas secas, pan blanco
sin levadura salpicado de manchitas rojas y azules, <i>toqueres</i> de maíz y
pastas dulces de leche, para las ofrendas que deben ponerse en los
sepulcros el día 2 de noviembre, el ambiente se perfuma con las rosas y
esencias traídas de los bosques, y en el atrio de la parroquia, en las
puertas de las casas, enormes ramas verdes indican que allí va a
rendirse culto a la memoria de algún muerto.</p>

<p>Las noches del «Colón,»<a name="FNanchor_1_1261" id="FNanchor_1_1261"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1261" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> las noches de los grandes estrenos, de las
grandes funciones de gala, de los grandes <i>débuts</i> .... Como todo el
mundo, yo había, naturalmente, oído hablar de todo eso. Sabía por los
Huret, por los Baudin, por los Clemenceau,<a name="FNanchor_2_1262" id="FNanchor_2_1262"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1262" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> que comparadas con ellas
las noches de la Opera parisiense resultan menos luminosas y menos
estrelladas. Sabía que sus<a name="page_254" id="page_254"></a> millares de espectadores representan, en los
días de lleno,<a name="FNanchor_3_1263" id="FNanchor_3_1263"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1263" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> la masa más considerable de níveas pecheras<a name="FNanchor_4_1264" id="FNanchor_4_1264"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1264" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> y de
brazos marmóreos que se ve en el mundo .... Pero todo esto, quizás por
la misma solemnidad de su renombre, parecíame de lejos hecho más para
sorprender que para seducir, y pensando en ello imaginábame algo como un
vano alarde de<a name="FNanchor_5_1265" id="FNanchor_5_1265"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1265" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> magnificencia argentina destinado a <i>épater</i><a name="FNanchor_6_1266" id="FNanchor_6_1266"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_1266" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> al
universo....</p>

<p>Pero fué el entreacto, el primero de los entreactos, lo que para mí
constituyó el verdadero espectáculo de la noche. ¡Qué luz!... ¡Qué
esplendor!... ¡Qué lujo!... Todos los esmaltes y todos los oros<a name="FNanchor_7_1267" id="FNanchor_7_1267"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_1267" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> de
las decoraciones palidecían ante aquel derroche de matices vivos. Y no
era un derroche de joyas, no; no era una riqueza fácil y de gusto
dudoso<a name="FNanchor_8_1268" id="FNanchor_8_1268"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_1268" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> lo que constituía tal iluminación. Menos pedrerías creo haber
visto en la formidable sala que en cualquier teatro de Montmartre. Eran
los esmaltes frescos de las mejillas, eran los alabastros de las manos,
eran los zafiros y las turquesas de las pupilas, eran los mármoles de
las gargantas, y eran, además, los áureos reflejos de las cabelleras
rubias y las sombrías madejas de las cabelleras negras, y eran, en fin,
las gasas, los tules, los encajes, lo que hacía el cuadro mil veces más
grandioso y más gracioso, y más rico también que todos los que hasta
entonces había yo visto.</p>

<p>Sí; ni en la Opera, de París; ni en el Real, de Madrid; ni en el Covent
Garden, de Londres; ni en ninguna parte, nunca, pero<a name="page_255" id="page_255"></a> nunca,<a name="FNanchor_9_1269" id="FNanchor_9_1269"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_1269" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> tan
bello, tan inmenso florecimiento había animado ante mis ojos las
clásicas <i>corbeilles</i><a name="FNanchor_10_1270" id="FNanchor_10_1270"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_1270" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> de un teatro. Todo era impecable, y al mismo
tiempo todo era amable.</p>

<p class="cb">. . . . .
. . . . .
. . . . .
. . . . .
. . . . .</p>

<p>Un grande y discreto y dulce soplo hacía ondular los tallos de mil
matices sobre el fondo rosa de los cortinajes y el oro grave de las
molduras. Era la vida, era la noble vida de todo un<a name="FNanchor_11_1271" id="FNanchor_11_1271"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_1271" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> universo
femenino.</p>

<p>Y por una especie de milagro que honra a los argentinos, hubiérase dicho
que los hombres se habían puesto de acuerdo para<a name="FNanchor_12_1272" id="FNanchor_12_1272"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_1272" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> desaparecer, poco a
poco, hasta no dejar en los palcos sino los ramilletes de damas color de
abril, de damas flores, en el gran panorama que habría hecho larga y
místicamente palpitar el alma del caballero Lohengrin.</p>

<p>A medida que van descendiendo se acrecienta el calor, se agiganta la
naturaleza. Un bienestar intenso, un regocijo palpitante, vigoroso,
parece filtrarse a un mismo tiempo en la savia y en la sangre; en los
árboles y los corazones. Se acercan al río, cruzan el puente entre un
redoble de cascos<a name="FNanchor_1_1273" id="FNanchor_1_1273"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1273" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>; salen a una planada cubierta de árboles frutales,
en donde el río Blanco y<a name="page_256" id="page_256"></a> el río Negro se encuentran, se abrazan,
confunden sus aguas en el estrépito de sus ondas.</p>

<p>Todos, en una explosión de libertad y de entusiasmo, cantan, estallan en
carcajadas, corren por la planicie, hacen girar los caballos empapados
en sudor, remolinean en grupos apretados, arrancan a manos llenas<a name="FNanchor_2_1274" id="FNanchor_2_1274"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1274" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
sartales de flores, desgajan los racimos de pomarrosas, se embriagan en
la fragancia de los limoneros, se arrojan puñados de azahares, y hacen
rodar por la grama el oro de las naranjas. Las emanaciones potentes de
la tierra penetran en los pulmones, el vigor tropical sube a la cara y,
unido a la alegría de la fiesta, les enciende las sienes, los envuelve
en una atmósfera vibrante que da a las arterias pulsaciones de fiebre.
La excitación de la alegría los fatiga, la tensión del entusiasmo se
afloja, la energía para el placer se ablanda, la voluntad se deslíe, y
entonces un vaho de sopor, una onda de languidez y de ternura los
envuelve, los penetra, los sumerge dulcemente.</p>

<p>La quena, fabricada generalmente con una caña peculiar de las montañas
del Perú, mide media vara de largo y dos tercios de pulgada de diámetro.
Abierta por sus dos extremos, con la embocadura formada por un recorte
en forma de rectángulo, pero cuyo lado superior está eliminado y el
opuesto a éste cortado, como en los clarinetes, hacia el ulterior y en
forma de chaflán, tiene cinco agujeros en la parte superior y uno al
costado, por cuya razón solo produce semi-tonos-fúnebres.<a name="page_257" id="page_257"></a></p>

<p>Los indios introducen algunas veces una parte de la quena en cántaros de
barro, horadados exprofeso. Por medio de esta operación, las
melancólicas voces de la flauta americana adquieren una resonancia y una
tristeza imponderables.</p>

<p>El <i>yaraví</i> o <i>haraví</i>, que se canta acompañado por la quena, existía,
como ésta, en la época de la dominación de los Incas. Los tocadores de
quena ejecutan dúos inolvidables para el que es capaz de percibir,
dentro de tan imperfecto instrumento, el alma sollozante del indio
triste. Una de las quenas lleva el canto y otra el acompañamiento, o la
primera hace una especie de reclamo, al cual responde la segunda a la
distancia.</p>

<p>Es imponderable la sensación que produce el diálogo de las flautas,
cuando se le escucha en la montaña, áspera como el camino de la vida, y
en una noche nebulosa como el destino del músico desdichado.</p>

<p>Salió bien pronto la procesión. El pueblo se prosternó respetuosamente,
y ya no se oía sino el canto sagrado, el alegre tañido de las campanas y
el tamboril y el pito de la danza que iba bailando delante del Santo
Sacramento.<a name="FNanchor_1_1276" id="FNanchor_1_1276"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1276" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Entonces empezó a arder un castillo de pólvora,<a name="FNanchor_2_1277" id="FNanchor_2_1277"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1277" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
preparado para la primera estación. Dos indios de la danza fingieron
caer con los rostros contra la tierra. Al cesar el ruido de la pólvora,
volvieron a levantarse y continuaron ágiles y alegres su incansable
danza. Pero cuantas veces se quemaron castillos o ruedas, ellos
repitieron aquella expresiva pantomima. Confieso que no pude ya
resistir<a name="page_258" id="page_258"></a> la impresión que me causó aquella escena. Mis lágrimas
corrieron al ver la inocente y cándida alegría con que los descendientes
de los antiguos dueños del suelo americano renuevan en una pantomima
tradicional la imagen de su destrucción, el recuerdo ominoso y amargo
del tiempo en que sus abuelos fueron casi exterminados y vilmente
esclavizados por aquellos hombres terribles, que en su concepto,
manejaban el rayo. En el trascurso de más de tres siglos estos hijos
degenerados de una raza valiente y numerosa, ignorantes de su origen, de
sus derechos y de su propia miseria, celebran una fiesta cristiana
contrahaciendo momentáneamente los usos de sus mayores y se ríen
representando el terror de sus padres en aquellos días aciagos en que
sus opresores los aniquilaban para formar colonias europeas sobre los
despojos de una grande y poderosa nación.</p>

<p>El <i>puchero</i><a name="FNanchor_1_1278" id="FNanchor_1_1278"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1278" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> ha quedado como resumen de todo lo que el ama de casa
tiene a mano; carne de buey, espigas de maíz tierno, zapallo, papas,
zanahorias, tomates, arroz y pimientos se dan cita en la marmita y
aparecen en la mesa, en una mezcolanza abundante y burguesa, al que hay
que hacer los honores sin escrúpulo.<a name="FNanchor_2_1279" id="FNanchor_2_1279"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1279" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Sin que nos metamos a<a name="FNanchor_3_1280" id="FNanchor_3_1280"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1280" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
criticarlo, este plato español ha conquistado su carta de naturaleza y
se ha convertido en plato nacional. Es también el plato cotidiano. Es
tal vez<a name="page_259" id="page_259"></a> este su defecto, pero hace también seguramente su mérito.
¡Dichosos los pueblos que pueden comer el puchero dos veces al día!
Quéjese el que quiera de esta monotonía muy alimenticia....</p>

<p>El puchero es en suma el gran recurso culinario del país; contiene la
solución del problema de la vida para todos, y todos pueden
procurárselo, satisfaciendo el apetito de toda su familia con veinte
centavos próximamente. Las mismas gentes ricas tienen a este modesto
plato nacional tal apego, que cuando viajan por Europa, la ausencia del
puchero destruye en parte el encanto que produce la cocina sabia,<a name="FNanchor_4_1281" id="FNanchor_4_1281"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1281" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> y
se consideran dichosos si logran encontrar en alguna parte el recuerdo
de la patria ausente y del hogar abandonado en medio de los cálidos
vapores que aquél exhala.</p>

<p>Este plato nacional tiene por todas partes un compañero obligado, el
<i>asado</i>; pero es preciso que este asado reuna ciertas condiciones.
Primeramente es preciso para llenar las condiciones de sabor deseado que
el pedazo sea cortado en las partes firmes de la pierna del buey, allí
donde la carne es más resistente. El carnero en la ciudad está
enteramente proscrito y nunca ha sido admitido a figurar, bajo ninguna
forma, sobre la mesa de un criollo, respetuoso de la tradición. Animal
largo tiempo desdeñado, no se ha levantado aún a los ojos de los
criollos del largo abandono en que vegetaba hace aún un cuarto de siglo;
por el contrario es muy buscado de<a name="FNanchor_5_1282" id="FNanchor_5_1282"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1282" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> los extranjeros y por esta causa
el consumo aumenta extraordinariamente. En los campos hay que
contentarse con él; pues no se puede por todas partes sacrificar el
ganado mayor para la alimentación. De todas las partes del carnero la
más desdeñada es la pierna y en<a name="page_260" id="page_260"></a> realidad no dejan de<a name="FNanchor_6_1283" id="FNanchor_6_1283"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_1283" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> tener razón
para ello. El rebaño se cría en libertad en una vasta extensión que no
es nunca menor de doscientas cincuenta hectáreas; por allí corre a su
guisa,<a name="FNanchor_7_1284" id="FNanchor_7_1284"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_1284" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> marcha y circula sin conocer nunca, ni aún en el invierno, el
reposo del establo; estas grandes marchas dan a la fibra de esta parte
carnosa una resistencia poco agradable y un gusto diferente de la del
carnero criado en países donde la propiedad está muy dividida y donde es
de regla<a name="FNanchor_8_1285" id="FNanchor_8_1285"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_1285" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> la estabulación.</p>

<h4><a name="II-34" id="II-34"></a>34.&mdash;EL HOJALATERO<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h4>

<p>Dotado nuestro tipo de una actividad siempre creciente, recorre con sus
latas todos los pueblos de la Isla, sin dejar en el intermedio una
hacienda, un barrio, un caserío, una sola choza que no visite. Concluida
una expedición, vuelve al instante a emprender otra, sin detenerse más
tiempo que el necesario para completar su nueva carga de embudos,
cafeteras y faroles.</p>

<p>Cual otro <i>Judío errante</i> impulsado por la secreta voz de su codicia,
anda... anda sin cesar, llevando el <i>cargamento</i> en las espaldas, a
guisa de caracol.</p>

<p>Y no se limitan sus funciones a comprar, por ejemplo, una lata en cuatro
reales para venderla después en cuatro duros; no señor; además de esto
suele dedicarse a soldar lo despegado, remendar lo roto y a enderezar
entuertos<a name="FNanchor_1_1286" id="FNanchor_1_1286"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1286" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> y abolladuras, siempre que<a name="FNanchor_2_1287" id="FNanchor_2_1287"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1287" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> se le pague como
corresponde.<a name="page_261" id="page_261"></a></p>

<p>También suele comprar calderas, pailas y sartenes viejas en una parte de
la Isla, para venderlas por nuevas<a name="FNanchor_3_1288" id="FNanchor_3_1288"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1288" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> en la otra, si es que no logra
colocarlas en la misma parte donde las adquirió.</p>

<p>Aun no está bien averiguado si el <i>hojalatero</i> come, bebe, fuma y
satisface, en fin, las demás necesidades de la vida; pero lo cierto es
que<a name="FNanchor_4_1289" id="FNanchor_4_1289"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1289" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> no se permite<a name="FNanchor_5_1290" id="FNanchor_5_1290"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1290" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> gastar dinero en cosas tales. No quiere esto
decir que<a name="FNanchor_6_1291" id="FNanchor_6_1291"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_1291" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> las desprecie, ni que de ellas se prive en absoluto; que no

<p>Paisano, al fin,<a name="FNanchor_10_1295" id="FNanchor_10_1295"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_1295" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> de Verdi y Donizetti, nuestro tipo tiene también
sus ribetes de filarmónico, y cuando camina por despoblado suele tocar
la sinfonía, cantando al mismo tiempo en alta voz el <i>Inno di
Garibaldi</i>, el <i>Addio della partenza</i>, o <i>el Alma innamorata</i>.</p>

<p>Su lenguaje no es italiano ni español, aunque participa de ambos; es una
graciosa mezcolanza de palabras españolas italianizadas y vice-versa,
formada por él para su uso particular. Puede decirse, pues, que habla en
hojalatero.</p>

<h4><a name="II-35" id="II-35"></a>35.&mdash;MI EDUCACIÓN<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h4>

<p>Tenía mis libros sobre la mesa del comedor, apartábalos para que
sirvieran el almuerzo, después para la comida, en la noche para la cena;
la vela se extinguía a las dos de la mañana, y cuando la lectura me
apasionaba, me pasaba<a name="FNanchor_1_1296" id="FNanchor_1_1296"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1296" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> tres días sentado registrando en el
diccionario. Catorce años he puesto después en aprender a pronunciar el
francés que no he hablado hasta 1846, después de haber llegado a
Francia. En 1833, estuve de dependiente de comercio en Valparaíso,
ganaba una onza mensual, y de ella destinaba media para pagar al
profesor de inglés Richard, y dos reales semanales al sereno del barrio
para que me despertase a las dos de la mañana a estudiar mi inglés. Los
sábados los pasaba en vela<a name="FNanchor_2_1297" id="FNanchor_2_1297"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1297" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> para hacerlos de una pieza con<a name="FNanchor_3_1298" id="FNanchor_3_1298"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1298" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> los
domingos; y después de mes y medio de lecciones, Richard me dijo que no
me faltaba ya sino<a name="FNanchor_4_1299" id="FNanchor_4_1299"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1299" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> la pronunciación, que hasta hoy he<a name="FNanchor_5_1300" id="FNanchor_5_1300"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1300" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> podido
adquirir. Fuíme a Copiapó, y, mayordomo indigno de la Colorada,<a name="FNanchor_6_1301" id="FNanchor_6_1301"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_1301" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> que
tanta plata en barra escondía a mis ojos, traduje a volumen por día<a name="FNanchor_7_1302" id="FNanchor_7_1302"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_1302" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
los sesenta de la colección completa de novelas de Walter Scott, y otras
muchas obras que debí a la oficiosidad de Mr. Eduardo Abott.</p>

<p>En 1837, aprendí el italiano en San Juan, por acompañar al<a name="page_263" id="page_263"></a> joven
Rawson,<a name="FNanchor_8_1303" id="FNanchor_8_1303"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_1303" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> cuyos talentos comenzaban desde entonces<a name="FNanchor_9_1304" id="FNanchor_9_1304"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_1304" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> a manifestarse.
Ultimamente en 1842, redactando «El Mercurio,»<a name="FNanchor_10_1305" id="FNanchor_10_1305"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_1305" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> me familiaricé con el
portugués, que no requiere aprenderse. En París me encerré quince días
con una gramática y un diccionario, y traduje seis páginas de alemán, a
satisfacción de<a name="FNanchor_11_1306" id="FNanchor_11_1306"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_1306" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> un inteligente a quien dí lección, dejándome
desmontado aquel supremo esfuerzo, no obstante que creía haber cogido ya
la estructura del rebelde idioma.</p>

terreno para obtener raíces comestibles. Esta vida activa y dura, sus

<h4><a name="II-37" id="II-37"></a>37.&mdash;LA MUJER HISPANO-AMERICANA<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h4>

<p>El sentimiento de la maternidad domina en la mujer de la
Hispano-América. Cierta filosofía<a name="FNanchor_1_1313" id="FNanchor_1_1313"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1313" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> pretende que ese sentimiento no es
más que instintivo, que no se encuentra con el carácter de pasión más
que en la mujer primitiva y del que se despoja la mujer de la
civilización refinada, elevándose así por encima de la vulgaridad de sus
congéneres y limitando sus ambiciones a la reproducción, por raros
ejemplares, de sus altas cualidades de raza.</p>

<p>La mujer no se ha contaminado con estas doctrinas. Cifra una especie de
orgullo en rodearse de una numerosa descendencia; por una extraordinaria
condición de su naturaleza cada vez sale más rejuvenecida después de las
dolorosas pruebas de la más alta función social,&mdash;la primera en
importancia en un<a name="page_265" id="page_265"></a> país donde sólo el aumento de población puede
asegurar su civilización.</p>

<p>En el Plata no dominó la influencia del cura. Éste se halla muy lejos de
desempeñar el papel que, a causa de la mujer, ha conquistado en los
otros países católicos. Los conventos de monjas son raros y las
profesiones no abundan, al contrario de lo que en Chile sucede, donde
las comunidades de mujeres se multiplicaron desde el origen de la
colonia: servían de asilo a las mujeres, demasiado numerosas para una
población masculina constantemente diezmada por la guerra con los
Araucanos. La inmigración proporciona continuamente a Buenos Aires un
gran número de hombres adultos, siempre bastante considerable en
relación al de las mujeres indígenas. Las pocas mujeres que generalmente
con el carácter de esposas traía la emigración jamás ni aun hoy día han
llegado al diez por ciento total de los inmigrantes.</p>

<p>El «triste» que predomina en los pueblos del norte, es un canto frijio,

Rousseau.<a name="FNanchor_1_1314" id="FNanchor_1_1314"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1314" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>La «vidalita,» canto popular con coros, acompañado de la guitarra y un

cortejo y el estrépito de las voces, me parece heredado de los

celebración de la Candelaria<a name="FNanchor_2_1315" id="FNanchor_2_1315"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1315" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>; y como canto religioso, debe ser
antiguo, y los indios chilenos no<a name="page_266" id="page_266"></a> lo han de haber adoptado de los

con esmero, tuzado y acepillado; su persona limpia, sus prendas de
vestir<a name="FNanchor_3_1319" id="FNanchor_3_1319"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1319" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> colocadas con gracia sobre el cuerpo; sus cabellos y barbas
largos, pero peinados y cuidados, y en fin, aquel<a name="FNanchor_4_1320" id="FNanchor_4_1320"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1320" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> aire atrevido y
simpático a la vez, que parece decir a todos: «Yo soy el dueño de la
tierra, ustedes no son más que gringos», es lo que le da a conocer.</p>

<p>...El gaucho sólo es amigo de sus amigos, es decir de sus iguales, y a
los demás o los respeta o los desprecia: los respeta si son inteligentes
o bravos; los desprecia si son simples, cobardes o hablantines. Por lo
general el gaucho es reservado y comedido con las gentes que no conoce:
el temor de decir algún disparate que le deje en ridículo,<a name="FNanchor_5_1321" id="FNanchor_5_1321"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1321" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> le
contiene de hablar ante extraños. Como él mismo lo dice, no da a conocer
su juego<a name="FNanchor_6_1322" id="FNanchor_6_1322"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_1322" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> a dos<a name="page_267" id="page_267"></a> tirones, lo que equivale a expresar que sólo
acostumbra a abrir juicio<a name="FNanchor_7_1323" id="FNanchor_7_1323"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_1323" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> sobre lo que sabe y ante personas que trata
de continuo. La guitarra y el canto lo divierten sobremanera, y es capaz
de escuchar sin fastidio durante una noche a un guitarrista....</p>

<p>Para alabar o para vituperar las personas o las cosas, tiene recursos de
lenguaje, giros poéticos, expresiones originales que hieren los
sentimientos, penetrando de un modo especial en la inteligencia. Sin
cuidarse de completar sus frases, las enuncia por medio de comparaciones
y de referencias, que a pesar de su sencillez vulgar, tienen comunmente
un alcance profundo. Así para expresar que un hombre es valiente, dice
él: «es como las armas»<a name="FNanchor_8_1324" id="FNanchor_8_1324"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_1324" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>; que un hombre es vivo: que «es como la
luz»<a name="FNanchor_9_1325" id="FNanchor_9_1325"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_1325" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>; para hablar de una mujer linda, «es como las estrellas»; para
indicar un caballo rápido, «es como águila»; para elogiar a un individuo
firme que no cede a los embates de la mala fortuna, «es como
cuadro».<a name="FNanchor_10_1326" id="FNanchor_10_1326"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_1326" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Cuando habla de su caballo le llama «mancarrón»; a su mujer
«la china»<a name="FNanchor_11_1327" id="FNanchor_11_1327"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_1327" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>; a sus amigos «aparceros»; a los muchachos del campo,
«charabones». Si le entusiasma alguna aventura heroica que le cuentan,
demuestra su admiración por el héroe con esta exclamación: «¡Ah
criollo!» Si él narra algún lance en que un ginete bien montado<a name="FNanchor_12_1328" id="FNanchor_12_1328"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_1328" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
evitó un sablazo o una lanzada, ladeando el caballo, dice que «soslayó
el pingo».<a name="FNanchor_13_1329" id="FNanchor_13_1329"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_1329" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> No dice «tome usted», sino «velay»; al mate le llama «el
verde»,<a name="FNanchor_14_1330" id="FNanchor_14_1330"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_1330" class="fnanchor">[14]</a><a name="page_268" id="page_268"></a> a los tragos de caña o de ginebra «gorgoritos,» al
telégrafo eléctrico «el chismoso»,<a name="FNanchor_15_1331" id="FNanchor_15_1331"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_1331" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> al ferrocarril en señal de
admiración, «el bárbaro».<a name="FNanchor_16_1332" id="FNanchor_16_1332"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_1332" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Pero donde agota todo el repertorio de sus dichos, es en la enumeración
de las cualidades de un caballo que estima, y así dice: «es aseadito
para andar»,<a name="FNanchor_17_1333" id="FNanchor_17_1333"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_1333" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> «es el peón de la casa»,<a name="FNanchor_18_1334" id="FNanchor_18_1334"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_1334" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> «es mi crédito», «es
seguidor en el camino», «es liberal por donde lo busquen»,<a name="FNanchor_19_1335" id="FNanchor_19_1335"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_1335" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> «a donde
quiera endereza»,<a name="FNanchor_20_1336" id="FNanchor_20_1336"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_1336" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> etc.</p>

<p>En la conversación familiar, y cuando desea mostrarse cariñoso, sea con
los que están presentes o con algún amigo cuyo recuerdo le asalta,
emplea términos de su invención o diminutivos que dan una flexibilidad
singular a las palabras. Así a un hombre entendido en el baile o en la
guitarra, o muy sobresaliente en el juego, el canto o las carreras de
caballo, le llama «taura». A un amigo de valor personal<a name="FNanchor_21_1337" id="FNanchor_21_1337"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_1337" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> reputado, si
es viejo le llama «viejito quiebra»,<a name="FNanchor_22_1338" id="FNanchor_22_1338"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_1338" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> y si es joven «indio crudo». A
un parrandero que para poco en su casa,<a name="FNanchor_23_1339" id="FNanchor_23_1339"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_1339" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> le denomina «hombre gaucho».
Si pregunta su nombre a alguno, y este responde, «soy fulano, para
servir a usted»,<a name="FNanchor_24_1340" id="FNanchor_24_1340"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_1340" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> él le replica, «para servir a Dios».<a name="FNanchor_25_1341" id="FNanchor_25_1341"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_1341" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Si<a name="page_269" id="page_269"></a> entra
a una pulpería y le convida un extraño: «gracias, amigo, a pagar lo que
guste».<a name="FNanchor_26_1342" id="FNanchor_26_1342"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_1342" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Cuando da las señas de un paraje cercano, no dice más allá
sino «más allasito»; cuando se despide de los que estima, no dice adiós,
sino «adiosito»; cuando quiere afirmar que no conoce absolutamente nada
de un asunto, dice: «¡no sé cosísima ninguna!»</p>

<p>Sobresale también en buscar el lado ridículo de las cosas, y sus sátiras
son a veces divertidas, pero las más de las veces sangrientas. Del
hombre que sale poco de su casa, dice: «como peludo en la cueva»;<a name="FNanchor_27_1343" id="FNanchor_27_1343"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_1343" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> al
individuo de ciudad le llama «maturrango»; al extranjero «gringo»; y en
algunos casos «nación». Tiene refranes particulares de su cosecha<a name="FNanchor_28_1344" id="FNanchor_28_1344"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_1344" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
para caracterizar todas las circunstancias de que se ven aquéllos a
quienes profesa ojeriza. Cuando alguno o algunos individuos que no son
de campo<a name="FNanchor_29_1345" id="FNanchor_29_1345"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_1345" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> se presentan a participar del asado que hay en el fogón, el
gaucho que sabe bien que van a estropear la carne, dice: «¡ya cayeron
los <i>chimangos</i>!» A su enemigo lo llama «sotreta»; al caballo de su
enemigo «matungo»; a las armas de un enemigo «armas solas»<a name="FNanchor_30_1346" id="FNanchor_30_1346"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_1346" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>.</p>

<p>Las tres grandes pasiones del gaucho son: el juego (naipes, taba y
carreras), las mujeres y la guerra. Sus vicios son: el mate, el cigarro
y el baile. El juego acorta los largos días de holganza campestre, las
mujeres suavizan la aspereza de su carácter cerril, y la guerra ejercita
su espíritu aventurero. Cuando no juega, enamora o pelea; fuma, toma
mate, o baila. Su modo de dormir es un misterio, y hasta parece que el
sueño <a name="page_270" id="page_270"></a>no fuese para él una necesidad. Tiene el más completo desprecio
por los dormilones, así es que de los que duermen siesta antes del medio
día, dice «duermen la siesta del burro»<a name="FNanchor_31_1347" id="FNanchor_31_1347"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_1347" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> y cuando quiere satirizar a
alguno que ha sido desgraciado en la guerra, dice que «lo agarraron
durmiendo.»</p>

<p>El poncho, muy superior a la capa española por la facilidad en cubrirse
con él, y la desenvoltura en que deja los movimientos; el <i>chiripá</i> que
aventaja al pantalón para el hombre que está todo el día a caballo, la
bota de potro, fabricada por él mismo con un cuero de ese animal y
cómodamente dispuesta para no estrecharle; el pañuelo del cuello que
sirve de adorno y además de filtro para tomar agua en los arroyos y
cañadas, por cuya razón siempre es de seda; el lazo, las boleadoras y el
<i>facón</i>, que sirven para defenderse del hombre y de los enemigos; el
recado con todas sus <i>pilchas</i><a name="FNanchor_32_1348" id="FNanchor_32_1348"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_1348" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> que constituyen la silla y la cama
del viajero, hacen que el gaucho, así vestido y pertrechado, lleve
consigo a donde quiera que vaya, sus menesteres, su casa y su fortuna.</p>

<p>Era un ser excepcional. Tenía de Cayo Graco la sabiduría y la virtud; la
audacia de Agamenón y el perfil heroico de los<a name="page_272" id="page_272"></a> hombres de la
Gironda.<a name="FNanchor_1_1356" id="FNanchor_1_1356"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1356" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Todo era puro y excelso en aquel vástago extraordinario
perteneciente a la raza tan reducida de los predestinados, en aquel
arcángel majestuoso que parecía iluminado por la Victoria y bendecido
por el Destino.</p>

<p>Sus cartas, sus discursos, sus proclamas, ponen de relieve<a name="FNanchor_2_1357" id="FNanchor_2_1357"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1357" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> al hombre
de cerebro fecundo y centelleante que hizo, de la palabra, antorcha, y
del pensamiento, luminoso penacho. Acaso nadie, teniendo como tenía
Bolívar tan múltiples ocupaciones que apenas si<a name="FNanchor_3_1358" id="FNanchor_3_1358"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1358" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> le daban tiempo para
tomar la pluma o amalgamar ideas, pudiera producir tanta hermosura,
tanto párrafo sorprendente por la forma y por el fondo, tantas metáforas
e imágenes preciosas. Acompañaba al hecho, la expresión. Ponía la bomba
y prendía la mecha; unía el material y le añadía el explosivo; tras de
la arenga, la arremetida. Y así pasó su vida de visionario y de vidente,
mostrando y dejándose ver; dando ideas y practicándolas.</p>

<p>La persuasión y la discreción del hombre de estado; la sencillez de
Cincinato; la impetuosidad del guerrero estoico; la serenidad del hombre
inconmovible; la mirada del águila y la garra del león; la bondad de la
paloma y la dulzura del ruiseñor: Cada cosa en su oportunidad. Fiero,
cuando se necesitaba atacar; magnánimo, cuando la clemencia se imponía.
Bello, en el rasgo vigoroso, y en la sonrisa, suave. Imponente sin dejar
de ser<a name="FNanchor_4_1359" id="FNanchor_4_1359"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1359" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> humano; militar que con sólo clavar los ojos<a name="FNanchor_5_1360" id="FNanchor_5_1360"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1360" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> encendidos
dictaba una proclama y ordenaba un asalto. Era un león<a name="page_273" id="page_273"></a> que acariciaba.
No hay, no habrá en millares de años, temperamento, ni fuerza, ni
carácter, ni entereza, que sobrepujen las cualidades extraordinarias de
aquel atleta del ideal que tenía los resortes de la concepción y del
hecho encarnados en sí: apto para mandar y apto para ejecutar. Luchó con
el desinterés y la pasión de un evangélico sacerdote bajado de los
cielos para salvar los pueblos.</p>

<p>Bolívar era el héroe incólume que reunía todas las cualidades del genio:
Sólo así pudo llevar a las naciones de la roca Tarpeya al Capitolio.<a name="FNanchor_6_1361" id="FNanchor_6_1361"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_1361" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>San Martín, como ser físico, poseía una figura arrogante, altiva y en
todo militar. Había nacido soldado<a name="FNanchor_1_1363" id="FNanchor_1_1363"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1363" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> y murió soldado. Alto, moreno,
ancho de pecho, rígido como un sable, su espesa cabellera negra caía,
aún en su edad madura, en enérgicas guedejas sobre su frente atezada,
según se dejaba ver en un retrato casi juvenil, que de él se conservaba
en la sala del gobierno<a name="FNanchor_2_1364" id="FNanchor_2_1364"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1364" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> de la antigua Mendoza. En su vejez, peinaba
empero, sus canas cortadas militarmente, con la llaneza del cuartel. Su
nariz era aguileña, su barba saliente, su boca enérgica, si bien en sus
últimos años su espeso bigote, completamente cano, disimulaba<a name="page_274" id="page_274"></a> la
languidez de sus pliegues y la pérdida de su dentadura. Su vida entera
parecía, empero, concentrarse en sus ojos, de un negro brillante y
sombrío, en que todas las pasiones parecían teñirse de relámpagos, como
en los de aquel admirable tipo de belleza guerrera, su capitán favorito,
las Heras.</p>

<p>El sol que calentó la cuna de San Martín es tibio en comparación del que
ardió sobre la de Bolívar. Éste nace opulento y mimado en una ciudad
capital; aquél en la severa economía del hogar de un soldado, en una

<p>El hijo de Caracas pasea su primera juventud por las plazas de las
ruidosas cortes de la Europa extranjera; mientras el nativo de las
Misiones gasta sus tiernos años en los campamentos de los ejércitos de
un pueblo desgraciado, invadido por un usurpador injusto, y que defiende
su independencia a esfuerzos de<a name="FNanchor_3_1367" id="FNanchor_3_1367"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1367" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> patriotismo y de virtud....</p>

<p>Ambos al fin son víctimas del ostracismo. San Martín se<a name="page_275" id="page_275"></a> retempla y
prolonga en él sus días por la resignación magnánima y la digna espera
en la justicia futura; mientras que Bolívar, a semejanza del gran
desventurado de la fábula, se deja devorar las entrañas por el buitre de
la desesperación.</p>

<p>Un filósofo de veinte años, de cabeza olímpica y palabra elocuente,
escritor y tribuno poderoso, Francisco Bilbao, conmueve al pueblo
chileno en 1844, con su obra de crítica fundamental «La Sociabilidad
Chilena.»</p>

<p>Publica su hermosa obra en un periódico que es una predestinación: «El
Crepúsculo.»</p>

<p>Exclama con arrogante convencimiento y altiva independencia: «Sociedad,
¿qué has hecho de nuestro pasado, de la herencia gloriosa de la
revolución? Somos ciudadanos de nuestro tiempo y de nuestra patria y
venimos a pedirte cuenta de nuestro destino y de nuestro porvenir.»</p>

<p>Los espíritus reaccionarios se sintieron conmovidos y se alarmaron con
el levantado pensamiento del valiente reformador y lo procesaron para
amordazarlo. Lo llevaron al jurado y lo acusaron de blasfemo, de inmoral
y de sedicioso.</p>

<p>Él se defendió vigorosamente en un alegato que ha pasado a la
historia<a name="FNanchor_1_1373" id="FNanchor_1_1373"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1373" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> como el más notable que se ha hecho en América de la
soberanía de la razón y del pensamiento.<a name="page_277" id="page_277"></a></p>

<p>De aquella pira brotó la luz de la verdad y la razón, y se esparció por
el espacio de la América, alumbrando a las generaciones a través de las
edades. El reformador salió proscripto de su patria y fué al Perú y al
Ecuador a combatir por la abolición de la esclavitud. Escribió el
«Evangelio Americano» y redactó «La Voz del Nuevo Mundo,» descansando de
sus fatigas y luchas imponderables en la hospitalaria tierra argentina
que le brindó hogar, patria y una apacible tumba.</p>

<p>El esfuerzo de Sarmiento tendió siempre, más que a reformar las
instituciones y la legislación, a transformar las costumbres y las ideas
del pueblo. La noción de gobierno, esto es, la de una entidad tutelar y
directiva, nacida del consenso general, digna de respeto, necesariamente
fuerte y obligatoriamente honesta, empezó a entrar en el alma nacional
cuando, después de predicarla durante cuarenta años, Sarmiento la
encarnó en la Presidencia. Él marcó todos los rumbos definitivos: Al
maestro, la cultura que se refleja en el espíritu del niño que<a name="page_278" id="page_278"></a> educa;
al agricultor, la obligación de aliviar a la tierra, en su faena
sagrada, con la aplicación de los métodos e instrumentos más

<p>Y por último, sentado en un banquillo de madera frente a una mesita de
campaña, y rodeado de algunos jefes y oficiales, estaba un hombre.</p>

<p>Elevada era su estatura, fuerte y bien hecho su cuerpo, su tez cobriza,
su mirada estaba llena de inteligencia y viveza. Las hermosas y
varoniles facciones de su rostro expresaban en aquellos instantes
serenidad y reposo. Cubríale el labio superior negrísimo bigote: tenía
el resto de la cara limpio de barba. Representaba tener cuarenta y cinco
años, poco más o menos, y estar en la plenitud de sus fuerzas físicas e
intelectuales. Su vestido era sencillo, y en cuanto a las prendas del
traje, semejante al de los demás jefes. Llevaba puesta atravesada sobre
el ancho pecho una banda con tres estrellas, la cabeza desnuda y poblada
de ondeados y negros y abundosos cabellos, y en la boca un tabaco y una
leve sonrisa de triunfo....<a name="page_279" id="page_279"></a></p>

sentido retemblar las capas atmosféricas y las del suelo con el rugir

en gira de placer,<a name="FNanchor_2_1381" id="FNanchor_2_1381"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1381" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> para visitar a sus viejas amistades. Se alojó

alquiler,<a name="FNanchor_5_1384" id="FNanchor_5_1384"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1384" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> a pasear por el parque de Palermo. Así castigaba a los
políticos venales que van en carruajes deslumbrantes. Buenos Aires

estatua,&mdash;el reflejo de los grandes días de la patria.</p>

<p>Consiste la principal gloria del Sr. Rivadavia en haber colocado la
moral en la región del poder como base de su fuerza y permanencia, y en
comprender que la educación del pueblo es el elemento primordial de la
felicidad y engrandecimiento. Sobre estas columnas fundó una
administración que todavía no conoce rival en estos países, y parte de
cuyas creaciones, como puntos luminosos han lucido hasta en las negras
horas del gobierno bárbaro que por tantos años mantuvo detenido el carro
del progreso<a name="FNanchor_2_1395" id="FNanchor_2_1395"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1395" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> argentino....</p>

<p>Su razón fué elevada; su carácter recto y firme; sus intenciones
intachables. Nadie ha hecho más que él en favor de la civilización y de
la legalidad en estos países. Nadie ha amado con más desinterés y más
lisonja, más de veras<a name="FNanchor_3_1396" id="FNanchor_3_1396"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1396" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> al pueblo. Nadie ha respetado más que él la
dignidad de los compatriotas. Tuvo la conciencia de<a name="FNanchor_4_1397" id="FNanchor_4_1397"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1397" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> nuestras
necesidades y se desveló por satisfacerlas. Trajo a su rededor todas las
inteligencias, diólas impulso y las preparó un teatro útil y brillante
de acción. Buscó en el extranjero las ciencias de que carecíamos y las
aclimató en nuestro suelo. Compensó y alentó los servicios y las
virtudes; protegió las artes y confió más en el poder de la razón que en
el de la fuerza.</p>

<p>Su mérito es tan positivo, como su gloria será eterna.</p>

<p>El Ecuador era, en tiempos de<a name="FNanchor_1_1399" id="FNanchor_1_1399"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1399" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Montalvo, nido de clericales, y el
fanatismo gobernaba. La conciencia nacional, más que aletargada, parecía
muerta, y Montalvo no dió descanso<a name="FNanchor_2_1400" id="FNanchor_2_1400"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1400" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> a su pluma volteriana,<a name="FNanchor_3_1401" id="FNanchor_3_1401"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1401" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>

<p>Su pluma polícroma y erudita recorrió todos los campos de la literatura.
Filósofo idealista, escritor sereno de reposado estilo, polemista
indignado; periodista brillante, crítico sincero.</p>

<p>Temperamento bravío, evangélico, forjado para el bien y para el
martirio, consagró su vida a la patria: su gesto era siempre hermoso y
justiciero en defensa de sus altos intereses.</p>

<p>Fué el gran perseguido<a name="FNanchor_5_1403" id="FNanchor_5_1403"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1403" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> de su época. La tiranía detesta a los
iluminadores de conciencias y misioneros de la verdad, y cuando no halla
medio para silenciarlos, reduciéndolos a la impotencia, los persigue,
los insulta, haciéndolos vivir errantes como los israelitas a través del
desierto melancólico, de nostálgicos ideales. Pero el genio triunfa al
cabo de los protervos,<a name="FNanchor_6_1404" id="FNanchor_6_1404"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_1404" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> como las águilas alterosas de los reptiles de

<p>Los paladines de la libertad, y él fué uno de ellos, han sido<a name="page_284" id="page_284"></a> siempre
desterrados. Pero los grandes luchadores dominan desde lejos. El verbo
salvando la distancia, enciende y redime, inyecta fuerza a los oprimidos
y espanta a los opresores: así Martí dió vida a un pueblo: así Montalvo
hizo temblar a los tiranos.</p>

<p>Yo admiraba altamente el vigor general de aquel escritor único, a quien
había conocido por aquellas formidables y líricas correspondencias que
enviaba a diarios hispano-americanos, como «La Opinión Nacional», de
Caracas; «El Partido Liberal», de Méjico; y, sobre todo, «La Nación», de
Buenos Aires. Escribía una prosa profusa, llena de vitalidad y de color,
de plasticidad y de música. Se transparentaba el cultivo de los clásicos
españoles y el conocimiento de todas las literaturas antiguas y
modernas; y, sobre todo, el espíritu de un alto y maravilloso poeta. Fuí
puntual a la cita, y en los comienzos de la noche entraba en compañía de
Gonzalo de Quesada por una de las puertas laterales del edificio en
donde debía hablar el gran combatiente. Pasamos por un pasadizo sombrío;
y, de pronto, en un cuarto lleno de luz, me encontré entre los brazos<a name="FNanchor_1_1406" id="FNanchor_1_1406"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1406" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
de un hombre pequeño de cuerpo,<a name="FNanchor_2_1407" id="FNanchor_2_1407"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1407" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> rostro de iluminado, voz dulce y
dominadora al mismo tiempo y que me decía esta única palabra: «¡Hijo!»<a name="page_285" id="page_285"></a></p>

<p>Era la hora ya de aparecer ante el público, y me dijo que yo debía
acompañarle en la mesa directiva<a name="FNanchor_3_1408" id="FNanchor_3_1408"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1408" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>; y cuando me dí cuenta,<a name="FNanchor_4_1409" id="FNanchor_4_1409"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1409" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> después
de una rápida presentación a algunas personas, me encontré con ellas y
con Martí en un estrado, frente al numeroso público que saludaba con un
aplauso simpático. Martí tenía esa noche que<a name="FNanchor_5_1410" id="FNanchor_5_1410"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1410" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> defenderse. Había sido
acusado, no tengo presente<a name="FNanchor_6_1411" id="FNanchor_6_1411"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_1411" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> ya si de negligencia, o de precipitación,
en no sé cuál movimiento de invasión a Cuba. Es el caso, que<a name="FNanchor_7_1412" id="FNanchor_7_1412"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_1412" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> el
núcleo de la colonia le era en aquellos momentos contrario; mas aquel
orador sorprendente tenía recursos extraordinarios, y aprovechando mi
presencia, simpática para los cubanos que conocían al poeta,<a name="FNanchor_8_1413" id="FNanchor_8_1413"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_1413" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> hizo de
mí una presentación ornada de las mejores galas de su estilo. Los
aplausos vinieron entusiásticos, y él aprovechó el instante para
sincerarse de las sabidas acusaciones, y como ya tenía ganado al
público, y como pronunció en aquella ocasión uno de los más hermosos
discursos de su vida, el éxito fué completo y aquel auditorio, antes
hostil, le aclamó vibrante y prolongadamente.</p>

<p>Concluido el discurso, salimos a la calle. No bien<a name="FNanchor_9_1414" id="FNanchor_9_1414"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_1414" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> habíamos andado
algunos pasos, cuando oí que alguien le llamaba: «¡Don José! ¡Don José!»
Era un negro obrero que se le acercaba humilde y cariñoso. «Aquí le
traigo este recuerdito»,<a name="FNanchor_10_1415" id="FNanchor_10_1415"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_1415" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> le dijo. Y le entregó una lapicera de
plata. «Vea usted», me observó Martí, «el cariño de esos pobres negros
cigarreros.<a name="page_286" id="page_286"></a> Ellos se dan cuenta de<a name="FNanchor_11_1416" id="FNanchor_11_1416"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_1416" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> lo que sufro y lucho por la
libertad de nuestra pobre patria.» Luego fuimos a tomar el té a casa de
una su<a name="FNanchor_12_1417" id="FNanchor_12_1417"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_1417" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> amiga, dama inteligente y afectuosa, que le ayudaba mucho en
sus trabajos de revolucionario. Allí escuché por largo tiempo su
conversación. Nunca he encontrado, ni en Castelar mismo, un conversador
tan admirable. Era armonioso y familiar, dotado de una prodigiosa
memoria, y ágil y pronto para la cita,<a name="FNanchor_13_1418" id="FNanchor_13_1418"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_1418" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> para la reminiscencia, para
el dato, para la imagen. Pasé con él momentos inolvidables, luego me
despedí.<a name="FNanchor_14_1419" id="FNanchor_14_1419"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_1419" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> El tenía que partir esa misma noche para Tampa, con objeto
de arreglar no sé qué<a name="FNanchor_15_1420" id="FNanchor_15_1420"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_1420" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> preciosas disposiciones de organización. No le
volví a ver más.</p>

<h4><a name="IV-1" id="IV-1"></a>1.&mdash;LOS PRIMEROS PASOS<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h4>

<p>Antes que la civilización cristiana penetrara en América, era ya muy
estimado en ella el talento poético. Algunos príncipes mejicanos
difundieron las máximas de la moral, lloraron su esplendor decaído y
celebraron los primores de la naturaleza bajo las formas de la poesía.
Cuando la lengua de Castilla se arraigó en la parte meridional de
nuestro continente, sus hijos enriquecieron a la madre patria «no menos
con los tesoros de su suelo que con sus aventajados talentos que
fecundiza el sol<a name="page_288" id="page_288"></a> ardiente y desarrolla una naturaleza grandiosa y
magnífica.» Por entonces<a name="FNanchor_1_1426" id="FNanchor_1_1426"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1426" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> el sonido de las liras americanas se perdía
entre el grande concierto de las españolas: el hilo de agua,<a name="FNanchor_2_1427" id="FNanchor_2_1427"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1427" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> por
decirlo así, se engolfaba sin dejar huella<a name="FNanchor_3_1428" id="FNanchor_3_1428"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1428" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> en el mar a cuyo aliento
contribuía. Pero la revolución política que convirtió a los virreinatos
en repúblicas, encordó con bronce aquella lira. Y como la única
ocupación de los brazos fué el manejo de la espada, y la victoria la
exclusiva inspiratriz del ingenio, el carácter de la poesía, durante la
lucha de la emancipación, fué puramente guerrero.</p>

<p>Desde entonces hasta los días actuales toma la poesía otra dirección en
América.</p>

<p>La mayoría de las obras de la literatura americana de la última época
responden a una honda preocupación territorial, como es el estudio de
nuestro medio y de nuestra evolución orgánica.</p>

<p>Que en nuestra vida americana sobran asuntos de positivo interés, lo han
demostrado de antiguo, no sólo esas novelas o poemas románticos, hoy
célebres, que se llaman «María» y «Amalia,» y que se deben a la pluma de
dos poetas hondos y sinceros: Jorge Isaacs y José Mármol; lo demuestra
también, por otro concepto, ese modelo de sátira político-social que se
llama Blas Gil,<a name="FNanchor_1_1435" id="FNanchor_1_1435"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1435" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> que sin desdeñar el sabor clásico del estilo, nos
dejó como reflejo de la vida colombiana el literato-presidente José
Manuel Marroquín.<a name="FNanchor_2_1436" id="FNanchor_2_1436"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1436" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> En nuestros días, es muy variado y extenso el<a name="page_290" id="page_290"></a>
panorama de la novela en América, donde si bien es verdad que algunos
escritores como Enrique Rodríguez Larreta, el discutido autor de «La
gloria de don Ramiro»,<a name="FNanchor_3_1437" id="FNanchor_3_1437"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1437" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> eligen o prefieren temas exóticos, la mayoría
de los que al género novelesco se dedican ha sabido encontrar en el
marco de las costumbres nacionales asuntos múltiples que esperaban ser
explotados. Así Carlos Reyles y Eduardo Acevedo Días en Uruguay;
Francisco Sicardi, Roberto Payró y el fecundo Ocantos en la Argentina;
Emilio Rodríguez Mendoza en Chile; Manuel Díaz Rodríguez en Venezuela;
Manuel Zeno Gandía en Puerto Rico; Federico García Godoy y Tulio M.
Cestero en la República Dominicana; Federico Gamboa y Carlos González
Peña en Méjico; así, por último, en Cuba, Jesús Castellanos, que

naturalezas de su temple, cuando no han sido labradas por el rozamiento
brutal de la traición ni de ninguna de las miserias arrogantes y
agresivas que sombrean los caracteres: amando explosiva y angélicamente.
El teatro de sus amores es nuevo y espléndido: nuevo para el arte,
espléndido para la pasión. Pero ni los graves perfiles del Cauca ni la
indefinida serenidad de la Pampa prestan elemento al drama, cuando no
intervienen en él pasiones que se chocan y se anudan, y cuyo desarrollo
se desenlaza en la catástrofe o en la suprema delicia. Esta lucha no
existe en la «María».<a name="FNanchor_44_1484" id="FNanchor_44_1484"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_1484" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> El grupo de sus actores es un grupo hermoso,

<p>«Tabaré,» el poema de Juan Zorrilla de San Martín,<a name="FNanchor_72_1512" id="FNanchor_72_1512"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_1512" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> el escritor
uruguayo, parece inspirado por el medio ambiente, por la naturaleza
magnífica de la América del Sud, y por sentimientos, pasiones y formas
de pensar<a name="FNanchor_73_1513" id="FNanchor_73_1513"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_1513" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> que no son sencillamente españoles, sino que a más de
serlo,<a name="FNanchor_74_1514" id="FNanchor_74_1514"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_1514" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> se combinan con el sentir, el discurrir y el imaginar del
indio bravo, concebidos, no ya por mera observación externa, sino por
atavismo del sentido íntimo, y controversión en su profundidad, donde
quien sabe penetrar lo suficiente, ya descubre al ángel, aunque él esté
empecatado, ya descubre a la alimaña montaraz, aunque él sea suave y
culto. Ello es que en «Tabaré» se siente y se conoce que los salvajes
son de verdad,<a name="FNanchor_75_1515" id="FNanchor_75_1515"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_1515" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> y no de convención y amañados y contrahechos, como,
por ejemplo en «Atala».</p>

También nuestra América levanta palacios, y congrega el sobrante útil
del universo oprimido; también doma la selva, y le lleva el libro y el

el sol en la frente, surge sobre los desiertos coronada de ciudades. Y

<h4><a name="V-3" id="V-3"></a>3.&mdash;AMÉRICA<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h4>

<p>Cuando se estudian de cerca<a name="FNanchor_1_1528" id="FNanchor_1_1528"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1528" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> y sin pasión pueril los hechos, se
reconoce que no hay razón, que no hay justicia alguna en exigir de los
Americanos del Sur lo que no han podido conseguir en igual tiempo sus
propios padres,<a name="FNanchor_2_1529" id="FNanchor_2_1529"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1529" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> en ninguno de los pueblos meridionales de la misma
Europa.</p>

<p>Los americanos del Sur no pueden haber adquirido en menos tiempo,
mejores costumbres que sus maestros. Ellos han resuelto en principio
todas las dificultades sociales y políticas de nuestro tiempo, y sus
gobiernos están basados en las máximas de la verdad y la justicia: les
falta práctica, y ésta se adquiere en el ejercicio de la libertad. Las
ambiciones turbulentas que agitan de tiempo en tiempo a estos hombres,
no son eternas: ellas pasarán en la América del Sur como pasarán en
Francia, como pasaron hace ya tiempo en Inglaterra. ¿Qué motivo racional
hay para que así no sea? Solamente los hombres que permanecen en la
servidumbre son los que no llegarán jamás a ser libres.</p>

<p>Entre tanto no son sus trastornos, como suele pintarlos la pasión de los
extraños, ininterrumpidos: ha mucho tiempo que, fuera del campo de
batalla, no se derrama en esos pueblos sangre alguna por causas
políticas: depuestas las armas, los hombres contienen sus resentimientos
de partido, y se guardan entre sí<a name="page_309" id="page_309"></a> las consideraciones de la amistad.<a name="FNanchor_3_1530" id="FNanchor_3_1530"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1530" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
El trabajo, escaso antes de la revolución por las trabas sin cuento<a name="FNanchor_4_1531" id="FNanchor_4_1531"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1531" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
que lo agobiaban, se ha desarrollado bajo el amparo de la libertad:
lejos de decaer las grandes ciudades, se mejoran y prosperan: los
caminos de hierro comienzan, y en algunas repúblicas gozan de
importancia.</p>

<p>Sus ríos caudalosos, de origen desconocido y de navegación peligrosa, se
exploran en todos sentidos: su suelo fecundo repone con prontitud los
males de sus guerrillas pasajeras, y su comercio proporcional a su
población, aumenta con rapidez y sin interrupción. Evidentemente, todas
sus rentas, bien o mal distribuidas por los Estados, vuelven a la
circulación, y el trabajo se sostiene y aumenta.</p>

<p>La América del Sur posee escritores y poetas de primer orden, oradores
elocuentes y diplomáticos versados en el derecho de gentes, de una
habilidad y de una lucidez incontestables. La deuda de todas las
repúblicas juntas no es para imponer miedo a ningún hacendista, y todo
el mundo tiene la convicción, tanto en Europa como en América, de que
para enjugarla en pocos años, no tanto necesitan los sudamericanos de un
largo período de paz completa, como de costumbres morigeradas en todos
los ramos de la administración.</p>

<p>La ambición vulgar de mando, los compromisos de una política interior
bastarda, y el desorden consiguiente en el manejo y empleo de las rentas
son las causas principales del descrédito, exagerado a veces por el
interés y por la pasión, que de vez en cuando<a name="FNanchor_5_1532" id="FNanchor_5_1532"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1532" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> se une al nombre de
algunas de estas repúblicas. Su escasa población relativamente a la
extensión de sus vastísimas<a name="page_310" id="page_310"></a> comarcas, y la índole, los hábitos y la
poca instrucción en los ramos más útiles del trabajo, que caracterizan a
la gran mayoría de sus inmigrantes, agravan un tanto la situación. Mas
todos estos inconvenientes carecen de raíces profundas. La gran crisis
de la libertad está consumada; las costumbres de la vida pública
penetran en el corazón del pueblo, los soldados indomables de la
independencia, abrumados por la edad,<a name="FNanchor_6_1533" id="FNanchor_6_1533"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_1533" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> bajan al sepulcro<a name="FNanchor_7_1534" id="FNanchor_7_1534"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_1534" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> o
abandonan con las esperanzas de sus ambiciones las riendas del
Gobierno.<a name="FNanchor_8_1535" id="FNanchor_8_1535"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_1535" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Las nuevas generaciones, más ilustradas y menos avezadas
a<a name="FNanchor_9_1536" id="FNanchor_9_1536"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_1536" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> la vida de los campamentos, buscarán nuevas soluciones a las
dificultades de la política, y asentarán el porvenir de la patria
americana en la instrucción de las masas, en la actividad del trabajo,
en las luchas viriles e inteligentes de la opinión, asegurando así la
paz y la prosperidad interior. Acaso a fines del presente siglo, los
hechos infecundos y dramáticos de sus guerras intestinas pertenecerán a
la leyenda,<a name="FNanchor_10_1537" id="FNanchor_10_1537"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_1537" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> como los hechos de su gran transformación se inscribirán
definitivamente en la historia.</p>

asiáticos y los pueblos americanos y europeos se comuniquen por caminos
más breves con sus muchos y bellos puertos, sus innumerables riachuelos,
sus campos cubiertos de verdor perenne, sus privilegiados frutos, sus
feraces terrenos, su cielo encantador, su benigno clima; no se detendrá
sin duda en la marcha que ha emprendido. Mil y mil leguas de
ferrocarriles se entretejerán de punta a punta de la isla; las ruedas de
los barcos de vapor surcarán día y noche las aguas espumosas del mar,
muchos ríos se canalizarán; los terrenos pantanosos se desecarán y sobre
ellos crecerán lozanas plantas; no habrá espacio que no esté sembrado de
caña, de café o de tabaco; la población se decuplará; al lado de cada
puerto se levantará una ciudad elegantemente delineada y construida; se
abrirán, donde ahora hay caminos intransitables, largas y bellas
calzadas; se echarán sobre los ríos muchedumbre de soberbios puentes; se
introducirán todos los días máquinas e instrumentos para sacar de la
tierra los frutos que atesora; se mejorarán las razas de todos los
animales útiles; las siembras mismas se harán con aquel orden y aquella
simetría que son un indicio claro de los adelantos de los pueblos; las
groseras chozas de nuestros labradores se convertirán en graciosas
habitaciones rodeadas de árboles y de flores; todos los artículos se
abaratarán y se pondrán al alcance aun de las clases más pobres. El
viajero que descienda a las playas cubanas y visite las poblaciones y
las campiñas, así como el que hoy, después de treinta años de ausencia,
se admira de cómo camina esta tierra privilegiada, envidiará no haber
nacido bajo sus ceibas y sus palmas. Dirá en su patria cuán feliz vive
el hombre aquí, y millares de familias cansadas de trabajar en tierras
ingratas ya, y ansiosas de paz y de orden, cruzarán los mares, besarán
el suelo hospitalario que las recibe con los brazos abiertos,
descuajarán unas pocas yugadas de terreno, fabricarán<a name="page_312" id="page_312"></a> su albergue,
arrojarán los granos en los surcos, y, en breve, nunca más les faltará
el alimento.</p>

<h4><a name="V-7" id="V-7"></a>7.&mdash;LA INFLUENCIA FRANCESA EN LA AMÉRICA LATINA<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h4>

<p>Si la influencia española fué un punto de partida,<a name="FNanchor_1_1545" id="FNanchor_1_1545"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1545" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> la influencia
francesa fué un punto de contacto donde se encendió el porvenir.</p>

<p>Se puede decir que Francia realizó la conquista de América con sus
libros. Los pueblos impacientes de vida, que se alejaban de la vieja
España como una bandada de adolescentes de una reunión de abuelas,
encontraron en el espíritu cautivante y primaveral de la nación de
Enrique IV la expresión de audacia, de la ironía, de la precisión, de la
incredulidad y del fuego que los consumía interiormente. Por una
coincidencia difícil de explicar, dado el alejamiento y la falta de
intercambio, el pensamiento francés traducía casi todos los matices
nacientes del alma latinoamericana y se superponía tan exactamente a sus
anhelos, que en determinados casos parecía nacido en la región y
elaborado por ella. Francia era la libertad política, religiosa,
financiera y hasta gramatical; Francia era la vida triunfante, sin
prohibiciones ni cortapisas; Francia era el deseo confuso de avanzar,
ganando terreno a la noche<a name="FNanchor_2_1546" id="FNanchor_2_1546"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1546" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> hasta las cimas más altas que podía
concebir el espíritu humano. La América del Sur se dió intelectualmente
a Francia con la ingenuidad de una virgen, se convirtió en su discípulo
respetuoso, la imitó hasta en sus errores y, desde lejos, modestamente,
consciente de su pequeñez, ató su destino al de aquella nación
portentosa que parecía reunir todas las excelencias y realizar todos los
sueños....</p>

<p>Los beneficios de la influencia francesa son visibles en la<a name="page_315" id="page_315"></a> literatura
latinoamericana, pues ésta cobró una flexibilidad, una amplitud, una
frescura, un atrevimiento, una independencia y sobre todo una atrayente
novedad de estilo que, aún en aquellas épocas en que la producción
literaria era insuficiente y elemental, anuncia la concisión, la
brevedad, el matiz y la fuerza de hoy.</p>

<p>El buen gusto, el sentido de la oportunidad, la elegancia y la sutileza
para descubrir círculos concéntricos interiores son características que
sólo ofrece la literatura francesa. Transportadas a nuestros países,
renovaron la sangre de la literatura española, diluyeron su pesadez,
podaron sus floraciones excesivas y transformaron su aspecto, como una
mujer delicada metamorfosea en <i>boudoir</i> propicio a la galantería el
frío salón vetusto de un castillo con historia.</p>

<h4><a name="V-8" id="V-8"></a>8.&mdash;MOSAICO DE PUEBLOS<br /><small><a href="#VOCABULARY2">(to the vocabulary section)</a></small></h4>

<p>La América latina no es en buenas cuentas una definida familia étnica
que en algún momento de su historia pudo haber formado una sola nación.
Ante todo, la disposición geográfica del territorio americano que va
desde el Río Grande a la Tierra del Fuego, no permite fácilmente la
cohesión de muchos millones de hombres en una misma comunidad de ideales
sociales, artísticos, religiosos; el hombre es hijo de las condiciones
climatéricas en que vive, y a lo largo de<a name="FNanchor_1_1547" id="FNanchor_1_1547"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1547" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> la América latina hay
individuos que se tuestan doce meses al sol, y otros que tiritan de
frío, y hay recios escaladores de montañas y míseros palúdicos de los
pantanos. Todo lo contrario de lo que ocurre en los Estados Unidos donde
el territorio es un trapecio casi llano, extendido<a name="page_316" id="page_316"></a> de mar a mar, con
uniformes condiciones de suelo y aire, apenas contradichas débilmente en
el termómetro.</p>

<p>La formación étnica es todavía más complicada, alternando el indio y el
español&mdash;que es por sí solo<a name="FNanchor_2_1548" id="FNanchor_2_1548"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1548" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> otro mosaico&mdash;en los dos primeros
puestos, pero no sin que influyera también en la distribución el negro,
presente aquí y allá,<a name="FNanchor_3_1549" id="FNanchor_3_1549"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1549" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> sobre todo en las Antillas; dándose el caso
de<a name="FNanchor_4_1550" id="FNanchor_4_1550"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1550" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> la congregación de tres razas bien determinadas y nada comunes
entre sí, con el resultado natural de inmensas diferencias según domine
el español como en Chile, el negro como en Haití, o el indio como en
Méjico.</p>

<p>Lo común, pues, no es la raza, como tampoco lo es la religión, ya que
encontraríamos en los Estados Unidos más católicos que en siete
repúblicas latinas juntas. Es más que nada el idioma, vínculo
importantísimo, aunque no definitivo, y es además el tipo de la
civilización, casi exclusivamente español y calcado en el modelo del
madrileño Ministerio de Ultramar.<a name="FNanchor_5_1551" id="FNanchor_5_1551"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1551" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Si es verdad que el indio y el
negro han representado numéricamente un gran contingente de fuerza
americana, no lo es menos que<a name="FNanchor_6_1552" id="FNanchor_6_1552"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_1552" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> siempre vivieron supeditados al amo,
que era el aventurero español, y luego a su hijo, el criollo de sangre
europea, que heredaba la civilización superior y con ella el mando. La
población blanca de cultura española ha sido, por consiguiente, la que
ha impreso a la América el tipo de ideología con que aparece en los
tiempos contemporáneos, sin que el negro ni el indio hayan conseguido
más trascendencia en las mezclas que añadir algunos<a name="page_317" id="page_317"></a> estigmas de
superstición, pereza o agresividad, a los que ya trajeron con su sangre
de presidio los primeros conquistadores. Pero ¿ha persistido de una
manera absoluta esa extensa hegemonía del tipo español de civilización
sobre los otros estratos inferiores? Esto es lo que se halla hoy en cien
brazas de agua<a name="FNanchor_7_1553" id="FNanchor_7_1553"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_1553" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> en el Brasil, también en parte de la América latina,
empieza a influir el elemento alemán; la Argentina absorbe día tras día
media población de la Italia meridional; Colombia y Venezuela buscan en
Francia sus orientaciones intelectuales; Méjico recibe los efluvios
salutíferos del utilitarismo <i>yankee</i>. La América es un campo abierto a
las más heterogéneas razas y actividades. ¿Quién puede asegurar que al
correr de medio siglo<a name="FNanchor_8_1554" id="FNanchor_8_1554"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_1554" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> perdure en estas regiones tropicales y
meridionales este exclusivismo de la fisonomía cultural española?</p>

<p>Debemos formular claramente al país lo que ha de ser en esta América de
las esperanzas humanas. La unidad de tierra y de raza; la predestinación
que comporta, al abrirle, la expansiva facilidad de los vientos marinos,
agentes de toda civilización feliz, su situación interoceánica; la
riqueza colosal, la ausencia de prejuicios, la democracia y la
hospitalidad, señalan a esta América como uno de los futuros imperios
universales a cuya formación parece tender la especie. Nuestro país debe
ser en ella el justo y el civilizador. Si hay un destino humano que
realizar aquí, adelantémonos a cargar con su responsabilidad y su peso.
Quien tenga el mérito del esfuerzo inicial, tendrá también la
recompensa.</p>

<p>La patria hostil de los riesgos permanentes, no es, por fortuna, la
nuestra. En esa misma jactancia de producción ganadera y agrícola, de
fortuna fácil, de hartura para los hombres del mundo, está patente el
deseo de ser útil. Espiritualicémoslo, y ya tenemos formulado su
destino.... La justicia es una sed y la civilización una siembra.
Asegure el país al continente la justicia de su derecho y de su espada.
Tiéndale el vínculo de sus rieles y de sus aguas transeuntes en nudo
fraternal, así como el buen labrador forma para toda la familia el haz
de espigas. Viva de hacer el bien por su dicha inherente. Vaya ofertando
en noble gratuidad, donde sea menester, el cántaro lleno. La luz de su

rocío.</p>

<p class="cb">NOTE</p>

<p><i>No modern language text-book vocabulary, no matter how extensive or
complete it may be in its application to the text it covers, can take
the place of a dictionary, and the vocabulary which follows is no
exception to this rule. Each student using this text-book should provide
himself with a good Spanish-English English-Spanish dictionary in a not
too abridged edition, and should, in addition, have access in the
class-room to the latest authorized edition of the</i> &ldquo;Diccionario de la
Lengua Castellana&rdquo; <i>published by the Royal Academy of Spain.</i></p>

<p><i>In preparing this vocabulary the author has kept clearly in mind the
previous preparation and equipment in Spanish of the students for whom
this book is intended. Such students will be familiar with the
rudimentary principles of Spanish grammatical construction before
beginning to read this text, and will have acquired a fairly extensive
working vocabulary in that language which should include a considerable
proportion of the nouns, adjectives, verbs and adverbs most commonly
used in simple everyday speech. Such words have, therefore, been
excluded from this vocabulary, except in cases where, because of unusual
idiomatic construction or other variation from ordinary usage, it has
seemed desirable to include them.</i></p>

<p><i>As a rule, only one form of a word has been translated in the
vocabulary, and this is particularly true of verbs, in which the
infinitive has had preferential attention. Throughout the vocabulary,
the English translation is the equivalent in each case of the
corresponding term in Spanish <b>in the sense in which it is used in the
reading text</b>. Particular care has been taken to avoid altogether, where
possible, or to give last, those misleading translations which, because
of close resemblance or identity in spelling&mdash;not in meaning&mdash;are
eternal stumbling-blocks in the acquirement of a foreign language. Few
synonyms in English are given, since exercise in Spanish variants,
rather than in English synonyms, is what the student needs.</i></p>

<p><i>It should be noted that no attempt has been made to include in the
vocabulary words from the idiomatic phrases and expressions explained in
the footnotes throughout the reading text, except in the few cases where
the meaning cannot be readily gained from the context. Similarly, many
Spanish Americanisms are not included because their meaning is either
obvious or has been sufficiently explained in the reading text.</i><a name="page_323" id="page_323"></a></p>

produced from scanned images of public domain material
from the Internet Archive.)


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
